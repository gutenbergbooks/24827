<h3>THREATENING WEATHER.</h3>


<div class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">To Se&ntilde;or</span>,<br /></div>
<div class='right'>
<i>Se&ntilde;or the illustrious Don John Montfort.</i><br />
</div>

<p><i>Honoured Se&ntilde;or and Brother:</i>&mdash;There are
several months that I wrote to inform you of
the deeply deplored death of my lamented
husband, Se&ntilde;or Don Richard Montfort. Your
letter of condolation and advice was balm
poured upon my bleeding wounds, received
before yesterday at the hands of my banker,
Don Miguel Pietoso. You are the brother of
my adored husband, your words are as if
spoken from his casket. You tell me, stay
at home, remain in quietness, till these alarms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of war are over. Alas! respectable se&ntilde;or,
to accomplish this? Havana is since the
shocking affair of the <i>Maine</i> in uproar; on
each side are threats, are cries, "Death to
the Americanos!" My bewept angel, Don
Richard, was in his heart Spanish, by birth
American; I see brows black upon me&mdash;me,
a Castilian!&mdash;when I go from my house.
Already they speak of to burn the houses
of wealthy Americans, to drive forth those
dwelling in.</p>

<p>Again, se&ntilde;or, my daughter, your niece
Margarita&mdash;what to do, I ask you, of this
young person? She is Cuban, she is fanatic,
she is impossible. I apply myself to instruct
her as her station and fortune demand, as
befits a Spanish lady of rank; she insubordinates
me, she makes mockery of my position
as head of her house. She teach her parrot
to cry "Viva Cuba Libre!" She play at
open windows her guitar, songs of Cuban
rebels, forbidden by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'authoritaties'">authorities</ins>. I exert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
my power, I exhort, I command,&mdash;she laughs
me at the nose, and sings more loud. I attend
that in few days we are all the two in
prison. What to do? you already know that
her betrothed, Se&ntilde;or Santillo de Santayana,
is dead a year ago of a calenture. Her
grief was excessive; she intended to die,
and made preparation costing large sums of
money for her obsequies. She forget all now,
she says, for her country. In this alarming
time, the freedom her father permitted her
(his extreme philanthropy overcoming his
judgmatism) becomes impossible. I implore
you, highly honoured se&ntilde;or and brother, to
write your commands to this unhappy child,
that she submit herself to me, her guardian
in nature, until you can assert your legal
potencies. I intend shortly to make retreat
in the holy convent of the White Sisters, few
miles from here. Rita accompanionates me,
and I trust there to change the spirit of
rebellion so shocking in a young person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
unmarried, into the soul docile and sheep-like
as becomes a highly native Spanish maiden.
The Sisters are of justice celebrated for their
pious austerities and the firmness of their
rule. Rita will remain with them until peace
is assured, or until your emissaries apport
distinct advice.</p>

<p>For me, your kind and gracious inquiries
would have watered my heart were it not
already blasted. Desolation must attend my
remaining years; but through them all I shall
be, dear se&ntilde;or and brother, your most grateful
and in affliction devoted sister and servant,</p>

<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Maria Concepcion de Naragua Montfort</span>.<br /></div>
<div><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Havana, April 30, 1898.</i></span><br /><br /><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest, dearest Uncle</span>:&mdash;My stepmother
says she has written to you concerning
me. I implore you, as you loved your
brother, my sainted father, to believe no
single word she says. This woman is of a
duplicity, a falseness, impossible for your lofty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
soul to comprehend. It needs a Cuban, my
uncle, to understand a Spaniard. She wants
to take me to the convent, to those terrible
White Sisters, who will shave my head and
lacerate my flesh with heated scourges,&mdash;Manuela
has told me about them; scourges
of iron chains knotted and made hot,&mdash;me,
a Protestant, daughter of a free American.
Uncle John, it is my corpse alone that she
will carry there, understand that! Never will
I go alive. I have daggers; here on my wall
are many of them, beautifully arranged; I
polish them daily, it is my one mournful
pleasure; they are sharp as lightning, and
their lustre dazzles the eye. I have poison
also; a drop, and the daughter of your
brother is white and cold at the feet of her
murderess. Enough! she will be avenged.
Carlos Montfort lives; and you, too, I know
it, I feel it, would spring, would leap across
the sea to avenge your Rita, who fondly loves
you. Hear me swear, my uncle, on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
knees; never, never will I go alive to that
place of death, the convent. (I pray you to
pardon this blot; I spilt the ink, kneeling in
passion; what would you have?)</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your unhappy</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Rita</span>.<br /><br /><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Marguerite:</span>&mdash;I have written
to our dear and honoured uncle of the perils
which surround me. My life, my reason, are
at stake. It may be that I have but a few
weeks more to live. Every day, therefore,
dearest, let me pour out my soul to you, now
my one comfort on earth, since my heart was
laid in the grave of my Santayana.</p>

<p>It is night; all the house is wrapped in
slumber; I alone wake and weep. I seldom
sleep now, save by fitful snatches. I sit as
at this moment, by my little table, my taper
illuminated, in my peignoir (you would be
pleased with my peignoir, my poor Marguerite!
it is white <i>mousseline d'Inde</i>, flowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
very full from the shoulders, falling in
veritable clouds about me, with deep ruffles
of Valenciennes and bands of insertion; the
ribbons white, of course; maidens should
mourn in white, is it not so, Marguerite? no
colour has approached me since my bereavement;
fortunately black and white are both
becoming to me, while that other, Concepcion,
looks like a sick orange in either. Even the
flowers in my room are solely white.)</p>

<p>It seems a thousand years since I heard
from you, my cool snow-pearl of cousins.
Write more often to your Rita, she implores
you. I pine for news of you, of Uncle John,
of all at dear, dear Fernley. Alas! how
young I was there! a simple child, sporting
among the Northern daisies. Now, in the
whirlwind of my passionate existence, I look
back to that peaceful summer. For you, Marguerite,
the green oasis, the palm-trees, the
crystal spring; for me, the sand storm and
the fiery death. No matter! I live and die a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
daughter of Cuba, the gold star on my brow,
the three colours painted on my heart. Good
night, beloved! I kiss the happy paper that
goes to you. Till to-morrow, and while I
live,</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Rita</span>.<br /><br /><br />
</div>


<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Havana</span>, May 1, 1898.<br />
</div>

<p>Not until afternoon goes the mail steamer,
Marguerite, only pearl of my heart. I wrote
you a few burning words last night; then I
flung myself on my bed, hoping to lose my
sorrows for a few minutes in sleep. I slept,
a thing hardly known to me at present; it
was the sleep of exhaustion, Marguerite.
When I woke, Manuela was putting back
the curtains to let in the light of dawn. It
is still early morning, fresh and dewy, and I
am here in the garden. At no time of the
day is the garden more beautiful than now,
in the purity of the day's birth. I have described
it to you at night, with the <i>cocuyos</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gleaming like lamps in the green dusk of the
orange-trees, or the moonlight striking the
world to silver. I wish you could see it now&mdash;this
garden of my soul, so soon, it may be,
to be destroyed by ruthless hands of savage
Spaniards. The palms stand like stately pillars;
till the green plumes wave in the morning
breeze, one fancies a temple or cathedral,
with aisles of crowned verdure. Behind these
stand the banana-trees, rows and rows, with
clusters hanging thick, crimson and gold.
Would Peggy be happy here, do you think?
Poor little Peggy! How often I long to cut
down a tree, to send her whole bunches of
the fruit she delights in. The mangoes, too!
I used to think I could not live without mangoes.
When I went to you, it appeared that
I must die without my fruits; now their rich
pulp dries untasted by my lips: what have I
to do with food, save the bare necessary to
support what life remains? I am waiting
now for my coffee; at this moment Manuela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
brings it, with the grape-fruit and rolls, and
places it here on the table of green marble,
close by the fountain where I sit. The fountain
soothes my suffering heart, as it tinkles
in the broad basin of green marble. Nature,
Marguerite, speaks to the heart of despair.
You have not known despair, my best one;
may it be long, long before you do. Among
her other vices, this woman, Concepcion, would
like to starve me, in my own house. She
counts the rolls, she knows how many lumps
of sugar I put in my coffee; an hour will
dawn&mdash;I say no more! I am patient, Marguerite,
I am forbearing, a statue, marble
in the midst of fire; but beyond a certain
point I will not endure persecution, and I say
to you, let Concepcion Montfort, the widow
of my sainted father, beware!</p>

<img src="images/gs02.png" width="294" height="400" alt="IN THE GARDEN." title="IN THE GARDEN." />
<span class="caption">IN THE GARDEN.</span>
</div>

<p>Adios, my Magnolia Flower! I must feed
my birds. Already they are awake and calling
the mistress they love. They hang&mdash;I
have told you&mdash;in large airy cages, all round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
under the eaves of the summer-house beside
the fountain. They are beautiful, Margaret,
the Java sparrows, the little love-birds, the
splendid macaw, the paroquets, and mocking-birds;
but king among them all is Chiquito,
our parrot, Marguerite, yours and mine, the
one link here that binds me to my Northern
home; for I may call Fernley my home,
Uncle John has said it; the lonely orphan
can think of one spot where tender hearts
beat for her, not passionately, but with steadfast
pulses. Chico is in superb health; he is&mdash;I
tell you every time&mdash;a revelation in the
animal kingdom. More than this, he is a
bird of heart; he feels for me, feels intensely,
in this dark time. Only yesterday he bit old
Julio severely; I am persuaded it was his
love for me that prompted the act. Julio is
a Spaniard of the Spaniards, the slave of
Concepcion. He attempted to cajole my
Chico, he offered him sugar. To-day he
goes with his arm in a sling, and curses the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Cuban bird, with threats against his life.
Never mind, Marguerite! a time will soon
come&mdash;I can say no more. I am dumb; the
grave is less silent; but do you think your
Rita will submit eternally to tyranny and
despotism? No, you know she will not, it is
not her nature. You look, my best one, for
some outbreak of my passionate nature, you
attend that the volcano spring some sudden
hour into flame, overwhelming all in its path.
You are right, heart of my heart. You shall
not be disappointed. Rita will prove herself
worthy of your love. How? hush! ask not,
dream not! trust me and be silent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE STORM BURSTS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Greatly honoured Sir</span>:&mdash;I permit myself
the privilege of addressing your Excellency,
my name being known to you as man
of business of late your admired brother,
Se&ntilde;or Don Ricardo Montfort. I find myself,
se&ntilde;or, in a position of great hardness between
the two admirable ladies, Se&ntilde;ora Montfort,
widow of Don Ricardo, and his beautiful
daughter, the Se&ntilde;orita Margarita. These
ladies, admirable, as I have said, in beauty,
character, and abilities, find it, nevertheless,
impossible to live in harmony. As man of
affairs, I am present at painful scenes, which
wring the heart. Each cries to me to save
her from the other. The se&ntilde;ora desires to
make retreat at the convent of the White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Sisters, thrice holy and beatified persons, but
of a strictness repugnant to the lively and
ardent spirit of the se&ntilde;orita. Last evening
took place a terrible enactment, at which I
most unluckily assisted. Se&ntilde;ora Montfort
permitted her lofty spirit to assert itself
more strongly than her delicate corporosity
was able to endure, and fell into violent hystericality.
Her shrieks wanted little of
arousing the neighbourhood; the servants became
appalled and lost their reason. Se&ntilde;orita
Margarita maintained her calmness, and
even refused to consider the se&ntilde;ora's condition
as serious. On the assurance of the
young lady and the se&ntilde;ora's maid, I was
obliged to accept the belief that the se&ntilde;ora
would shortly recover if left to herself, and
came away in deep grief, leaving that illustrious
matron&mdash;I speak with respect&mdash;in
fits upon the floor. One would have said, a
child of six deprived of its toy. Greatly
honoured Se&ntilde;or Montfort, I am a man no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
longer young. Having myself no conjugal
ameliorations, I make no pretence to comprehend
the more delicate and complex nature
of females. I am cut to the heart; the
se&ntilde;ora scrupled not to address me as "Old
Fool." Heaven is my witness that I have
endeavoured of my best lights to smoothen
the path for her well-born and at present bereaved
feet. But what can I do? Neither
lady will listen to me. The se&ntilde;orita, let me
hasten to say, shows me always a tender, I
might without too great a presumption say a
filial, kindness. I held her in my arms from
the day of her birth, se&ntilde;or; she is the flower
of the world to me. When she takes me <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">by</ins>
the hands and says, "Dear old Donito Miguelito,
let me do as I desire and all will be
well!" I have no strength to resist her.
Had I a house of my own, I would take this
charming child home with me, to be my
daughter while she would; but&mdash;a bachelor
living in two rooms&mdash;what would you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
se&ntilde;or? it is not possible. Deign, I beseech
you, to consider this my respectful report, and
if circumstances are proprietary come to my
assistance, or send me instructions how to
act.</p>

<p>Accept, se&ntilde;or, the assurance of my perfect
consideration, and believe me</p>

<p><i>Honoured and dear Brother:</i>&mdash;Since I
wrote you last week, things the most frightful
have happened. Rita's conduct grew more
and more violent and unruled; in despair, I
sent for Don Miguel. This old man, though of
irreproached character, is of a weakness pitiable
to see in one wearing the form of mankind.
I called upon him to uphold me, and
command Rita to obey the wife of her father.
He had only smooth words for each of us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and endeavoured to charm this wretched
child, when terror should have been his
weapon. I leave you to imagine if she was
influenced by his gentle admonitions. To my
face she caressed him, and he responded to
her caresses. Don Miguel is an old man,
eighty years of age, but nevertheless my
anger, my just anger, rose to a height beyond
my power of control. I fainted from excess
of emotion; I lay as one dead, and no heart
stirred of my sufferings. Since then I have
been in my bed, with no power more than
has a babe of the cradle. This morning
Margarita came to me and expressed regret
for her conduct, saying that she was willing
from now to submit herself to my righteous
authority. I forgave her,&mdash;I am a Christian,
dear brother, and cannot forget the principles
of my holy religion,&mdash;and we embraced with
tears. This evening we go to the convent,
where I hope to find ease for my soul-wounds
and to subdue the frightful disposition of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stepdaughter. I feel it my duty to relate
these occurrences to you, dear and honoured
brother, for I feel that I may succumb under
the weight of my afflictions. We start this
evening, and Don Miguel will inform you of
our departure and safe arrival at the holy
convent, whither he accompanies us.</p>

<p>Permit me to express, dear brother, the
sentiments of exalted consideration with
which I must ever regard you as next in
blood to my adored consort, and believe me</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 16em;">Your devoted,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Maria Concepcion de Naragua Montfort.</span><br />
<br /><br /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Greatly honoured and illustrious
Sir:</span>&mdash;Let me entreat you to prepare yourself
for news of alarming nature. Yesterday
evening I was honoured by the commands of
the Se&ntilde;ora Montfort, that I convey her and
Se&ntilde;orita Margarita to the holy convent of the
White Sisters. My age, se&ntilde;or, is such that
a scene of emotion is infinitely distressing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
me, but I could not disobey the commands
of this illustrious lady, the widow of my
kindest patron and friend. I went, prepared
for tears, for outcries, perhaps for violent
resistance, for the ardent and high-strung
nature of my beloved Se&ntilde;orita Margarita is
well known to me. Figure to yourself,
honoured se&ntilde;or, my surprise at finding this
charming damsel calm, composed, even smiling.
She greeted me with her accustomed
tenderness; a more enchanting personality
does not, I am assured, adorn the earth than
that of this lovely child. She bade me have
no alarms for her, that all was well, she was
reconciled to her lot; indeed, she added that
she could not now wish things otherwise.
Amazed, but also enchanted with her docility
and sweetness, I gave her an old man's blessing,
and my prayers that the rigour of the
holy Sisters might be softened toward her
tender and high-spirited youth. She replied
that she had no fear of the Sisters; that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
truth she thought they would give her no
trouble of any kind. I was ravished with
this assurance, having, I may confess it to
you, se&ntilde;or, dreaded the contact between the
se&ntilde;orita and the holy Mother, a woman of
incredible force and piety. But I must hasten
my narrative. At seven o'clock last evening
two volantes were in readiness at the door
of the Montfort mansion. The first was
driven by the se&ntilde;ora's own man, the second
by Pasquale, a negro devoted since childhood
to the se&ntilde;orita. The se&ntilde;ora would have
placed her daughter in the first of these
vehicles; but no! the se&ntilde;orita sprang lightly
into the second volante, followed by her maid,
a young person, also tenderly attached to her.
Interposing myself to produce calm, I persuade
the admirable se&ntilde;ora to take the
position that etiquette commanded, in the
first carriage. It is done; I seat myself by
her side; procession is made. The way to
the convent of the White Sisters, se&ntilde;or, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a steep and rugged one; on either hand are
savage passes, are mountains of precipitation.
To conceive what happened, how is it possible?
When we reached the convent gate,
the second volante was empty. Assassinated
with terror, I make demand of Pasquale; he
admits that he may have slept during the
long traject up the hill. He swears that he
heard no sound, that no word was addressed
to him. He calls the saints to witness that
he is innocent; the saints make no reply,
but that is not uncommon. I search; I rend
the air with my cries; alone silence responds
to me. The se&ntilde;ora is carried fainting into
the convent, and I return to Havana, a man
distracted. I should say that in the carriage
was found the long mantle in which the
se&ntilde;orita had been gracefully attired; to its
fold a note pinned, addressed me in affectionate
terms, begging her dear Donito Miguelito
not to have fear, that she was going to Don
Carlos, her brother, and all would be well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Since then is two days, se&ntilde;or, that I have
not closed the eye. I attend a fit of illness,
from grief and anxiousness. In duty I intelligence
you of this dolorous event, praying
you not to think me guilty of sin without
pardon. I have deputed a messenger of trust
to scrub thoroughly the country in search of
Don Carlos, death to await him if he return
without news of my beloved se&ntilde;orita. He is
gone now twelve hours. If it arrive me at
any moment the tidings, I make instantly to
convey them to your Excellency, whether of
joy or affliction.</p>

<p>Receive, highly honoured se&ntilde;or, the assurance
of my consideration the most elevated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>ON THE WAY.</h3>


<p>"Ah, se&ntilde;orita! what will become of us?
I can go no farther. Will this wilderness
never end?"</p>

<p>"Courage, Manuela! Courage, daughter of
Cuba! See, it is growing light already. Look
at those streaks of gold in the east. A few
moments, and the sky will be bright; then
we shall see where we are going, and all will
be well. In the meantime, we are free, and
on Cuban soil. What can harm us?"</p>

<p>Rita looked around her with kindling eyes.
She was standing on a rock that jutted
from the hillside; it was a friendly rock, and
they had been sleeping under it, wrapped in
their warm cloaks, for the night was cool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
A group of palms nodded their green plumes
over the rock; on every side stretched a tangle
of shrubs and tall grasses, broken here
and there by palms, or by rocks like this.
Standing thus in the early morning light,
Rita was a picturesque figure indeed. She
was dressed in a blouse and short skirt of
black serge, with a white kerchief knotted
around her throat, and another twisted carelessly
around her broad-brimmed straw hat.
Her beautiful face was alight with eager
inquiry and determination; her eyes roved
over the landscape, as if seeking some familiar
figure; but all was strange so far. Manuela,
crouching at the foot of the rock, had lost,
for the moment, all the fire of her patriotism.
She was cold, poor Manuela; also, she had
had a heavy bag to carry, and her arms
ached, and she was hungry, and, if the truth
must be told, rather cross. It was absurd
to bring all these things into the desert.
What use for the white silk blouse, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
lace fichu? but indeed they had no weight,
whereas this monster of a&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is Chico?" asked Rita, coming down
from the rock. "Poor bird! what does he
think of our wandering? he must be in need
of food, Manuela. You brought the box of
seed?"</p>

<p>"I did, se&ntilde;orita; as to the need of birdseed
in a wilderness of hideous forest, I have
nothing to say. My fingers are so cramped
from carrying this detestable cage, I shall
never recover the full use of them. But the
se&ntilde;orita must be obeyed."</p>

<p>"Assuredly she must be obeyed!" said
Rita; and a flash of her eyes added force to
the words. "Could I have come away, I ask
you, and left this faithful, this patriot bird,
to starve, or be murdered outright? Old
Julio would have wrung his neck, you know
it well, Manuela, the first time he spoke out
from his heart, spoke the words of freedom
and patriotism that his mistress has taught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
him. Poor Chiquito! thou lovest me? thou
art glad that I brought thee away from that
place of tyranny and bloodshed? speak to thy
mistress, Chico!"</p>

<p>But Chico's spirits had been ruffled, as
well as Manuela's, by being carried about in
his cage, at unseemly hours, when he should
have been hanging quietly in the verandah,
where he belonged. He looked sulky, and
only said, "<i>Caramba! no mi gusta!</i>"</p>

<p>"He is hungry! he starves!" cried Rita;
"give me the seed!" Sitting down on the
rock, she proceeded to feed the parrot, as
composedly as if they were indeed on the
wide shaded verandah, instead of on a wild
hillside, far from sight or sound of anything
human.</p>

<p>"And the se&ntilde;orita's own breakfast?" said
Manuela at last, when Chiquito had had
enough, and had deigned to relax a little,
and even to mutter, "<i>Mi gustan todas!</i>" "Is
the se&ntilde;orita not also dying of hunger? for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
myself, I perish, but that is of little consequence,
save that my death will leave the
se&ntilde;orita alone&mdash;with the parrot."</p>

<p>Rita burst into merry laughter. "My poor
Manuela!" she said. "Thou shalt not perish.
Breakfast? we will have it this moment.
Where is the bag?"</p>

<p>The bag being produced,&mdash;it really was a
heavy one, and it was hardly to be wondered
at that Manuela should be a little peevish
about it,&mdash;Rita drew from it a substantial
box of chocolate, and a tin of biscuits. "My
child, we breakfast!" she announced. "If
kings desire to breakfast more royally, I
make them my compliment. For free Cubans,
bread and chocolate is a feast. Feast, then,
Manuela mine. Eat, and be happy!"</p>

<p>Bread&mdash;or rather, delicate biscuits, and
chocolate, were indeed a feast to the two
hungry girls. They nibbled and crunched,
and Manuela's spirits rose with every bite.
Rita's had no need to rise. She was having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a real adventure; her dreams were coming
true; she was a bona-fide heroine, in a bona-fide
"situation." "What have we in the
bag, best of Manuelas?" she asked. "I told
you in a general way; I even added some
trifles, for Carlos's comfort; poor dear Carlos!
But tell me what you put in, my best one!"</p>

<p>Manuela cast a rueful glance at the plump
valise.</p>

<p>"The white silk blouse," she said; "the
white peignoir with swansdown."</p>

<p>"In case of sickness!" cried Rita, interrupting.
"You would not have me ill, far from
my home, and bereft of every slightest comfort,
Manuela? surely you would not; I know
your kind heart too well. Besides, the peignoir
weighs nothing; a feather, a puff of
vapour. Go on! what else?"</p>

<p>"Changes of linen, of course," said
Manuela. "The gold-mounted toilet-set; two
bottles of eau de Cologne; cigarettes for the
Se&ntilde;orito Don Carlos; bonbons; the ivory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
writing-case; the feather fan; three pairs
of shoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! enough!" cried Rita. "We
shall do well, Manuela. You have been an
angel of thoughtfulness. You did not bring
any jewels? no? I thought perhaps the
Etruscan gold set, so simple, yet so rich,
might suit my altered life well enough; but
no matter. After all, what have I to do
with jewels now? The next question is, how
are we to find Carlos?"</p>

<p>"To find Don Carlos?" echoed Manuela.
"You know where he is, se&ntilde;orita?"</p>

<p>"But, assuredly!" said Rita, and she
looked about her confidently. "He is&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>"Here!" repeated Manuela.</p>

<p>"In the mountains!" said Rita, waving
her hand vaguely in the direction of the horizon.
"It is a search; we must look for him,
without doubt; but he is&mdash;here&mdash;somewhere.
Come, Manuela, do not look so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
despairing. I tell you, we shall meet friends,
it may be at any turn. The mountains are
full of the soldiers of Cuba; the first ones
we meet will take us to Carlos."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Manuela. "But what if we
met the others, se&ntilde;orita? what if we met
the Spanish soldiers first? Hark! what was
that?"</p>

<p>A sound was heard close behind them;
a rustling, sliding sound, as if something or
somebody were making his way swiftly
through the tall grass. Manuela clutched
her mistress's arm, trembling; Rita, rather
pale, but composed, looking steadily in the
direction of the noise. It came nearer&mdash;the
grass rustled and shook close beside
them; and out from the tufted tangle came&mdash;three
large land-crabs, scuttling along on
their ungainly claws, and evidently in a
hurry. Manuela uttered a shriek, but Rita
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" she said. "They are good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Cubans, the land-crabs. Many a good meal
has Carlos made on them, poor fellow. If
we followed them, Manuela? They may be
going&mdash;somewhere. Let us see!"</p>

<p>The crabs were soon out of sight, but
the two girls, taking up their burdens, followed
in the direction they had taken,
along the hillside, going they knew not
whither.</p>

<p>There seemed to be some faint suggestion
of a path. The grasses were bent aside, and
broken here and there; something had trodden
here, whether feet of men or of animals
one could not tell. But glad to have any
guide, however insufficient, the girls amused
themselves by trying to discover fresh marks
on tree or shrub or grass-clump. It was a
wild tangle, palms and mangoes, coarse
grass and savage-looking aloes, with wild
vines running riot everywhere. So far, they
had seen no sign of human life, and the sun
was now well up, his rays beating down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bright and hot. Suddenly, coming to a turn
on the hillside, they heard voices; a moment
later, and they were standing by a human
dwelling.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="271" height="400" alt="&quot;THE FAMISHED CHILD LOOKED FROM THE BISCUIT TO
THE GLOWING FACE.&quot;" title="&quot;THE FAMISHED CHILD LOOKED FROM THE BISCUIT TO
THE GLOWING FACE.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE FAMISHED CHILD LOOKED FROM THE BISCUIT TO
THE GLOWING FACE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>At first sight it looked more like the burrow
of some wild animal. It was little
more than a hole dug in the side of the clay
bank. Some boughs and palm-leaves were
wattled together to form a rustic porch, and
under this porch three people were sitting, on
the bare ground,&mdash;two women, one young,
the other old, and a little child, evidently
belonging to the young woman. They were
clothed in a few rags; their cheeks were hollow
with famine, their eyes burning with
fever. The old woman was stirring a handful
of meal into a pot of water; the others
looked on with painful eagerness. Rita recoiled
with a low cry of terror. She had
heard of this; these were some of the unhappy
peasants who had been driven from
their farms. She had never seen anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
like it before. This&mdash;this was not the play
she had come to see.</p>

<p>The women looked up, and saw the two
girls standing near. Instantly they began to
cry out, in wailing voices. "Go! go away!
there is nothing for you; nothing! we have
not more than a mouthful for ourselves.
Take yourselves away, and leave us in
peace."</p>

<p>Rita came forward, the tears running down
her cheeks. "Oh, poor things!" she cried.
"Poor souls, I want nothing. I am not hungry!
See!&mdash;I have brought food for you.
Quick, Manuela, the bag&mdash;the biscuits,
child! Give them to me! Here, thou little
one, take this, and eat; there is plenty
more!"</p>

<p>The famished child looked from the biscuit
to the glowing face that bent over it. It
made a feeble movement; then drew back in
fear. The old woman still clamoured to the
girls to go away; but the younger snatched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the biscuit, and began feeding the child hastily,
yet carefully. "Mother, be still!" she
said, imperiously. "Hush that noise! do you
not see this is no poor wretch like ourselves?
This is a noble lady come from heaven to
bring us help. Thanks, se&ntilde;orita!" With a
quick, graceful movement, she lifted the hem
of Rita's dress and pressed it to her lips.
"We were dying!" she said, simply. "It
was the last morsel; we meant to give it to
the little one, and some one might find it
when we were dead, and keep the life in it."</p>

<p>"But, eat; eat!" cried Rita, filling the
hands of both women with chocolate and
biscuits. "It is dreadful, terrible! oh, I
have heard of it, I have read of it, but I
had not seen, I had not known. Oh, if my
cousin Margaret were here, she would know
what to do! Eat, my poor starving ones.
You shall never be hungry again if I can
help it."</p>

<p>The child pulled its mother's ragged gown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it an angel?" it asked, its mouth full of
chocolate.</p>

<p>"Hear the innocent!" said the mother.
"No, lamb, not yet an angel, only a noble
lady on the road to heaven. See, se&ntilde;orita!
he was pretty, while his cheeks were round
and full. Still, his eyes are pretty, are they
not?"</p>

<p>"They are lovely! he is a darling!" cried
Rita; and she took the child in her arms,
and bent over him to hide the tears. Was
this truly Rita Montfort? Yes, the same Rita,
only awake now, for the first time now in
her pretty idle life. She felt of the little
limbs. They were mere skin and bone; no
sign of baby chubbiness, no curve or dimple.
Indeed, she had come but just in time.
"Listen!" she said, presently. "Where do
you come from? where is your home?"</p>

<p>The old woman made a gesture as wide
and vague as Rita's own of a few minutes
before. "Our home, noble lady? the wilder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ness
is our home to-day. Our little farm,
our cottage, our patch of cane, all gone, all
destroyed. Only the graves of our dead
left."</p>

<p>"We come from Velaya," said the young
woman. "It is miles from here; we were
driven out by the Spaniards. My father was
killed before our eyes; she is not herself since,
poor soul; do we wonder at it? we have
wandered ever since. My husband&mdash;do I
know if he is alive or dead? He was with
our men, he knows nothing of what has
happened. If he returns, he will think us
all dead. Poor Pedro! These are the conditions
of war, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>She spoke very quietly; but her simple
words pierced deeper than the plaints of the
poor old woman.</p>

<p>"Listen, again!" said Rita. "I am going
to my brother; he also is with our army; he
is with the General. Do you know, can you
tell me, in what direction to look for them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
When I find them, I will see; I will have provision
made for you. You must stay here
now, for a few hours; but have courage,
help will come soon. My brother Carlos and
the good General will care for you. Only
tell me where to find them, and all will be
well."</p>

<p>She spoke so confidently that hope and
courage seemed to go from her, and creep
into the hearts of the forlorn creatures. The
baby smiled, and stretched out its little fleshless
hands for more of the precious food;
even the old grandmother crept a little
nearer, to kiss the hand of their benefactress,
and call on all the saints to bless her
and bring her to Paradise. The younger
woman said there had been firing yesterday
in that direction, and she pointed westward
over the brow of a hill. They had seen
no Cuban soldiers since they had been here,
but a boy had passed by this morning, on his
way to join the General, and he took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
same westerly direction, and said the nearest
pickets were not far distant.</p>

<p>"And why did you not follow him?"
asked Rita. "Why did you not go with
him, and throw yourself at the feet of our
good General, as I will do for you now?
Yes, yes, I know; you were too weak, poor
souls; you had no strength to travel farther.
But I am young and strong, and so is Manuela;
and we will go together, and soon we
will come again, or send help for you. Manuela,
will you come with me? or will it be
better for you to stay and care for these poor
ones while I seek Don Carlos?"</p>

<p>But Manuela was, very properly, scandalised
at the thought of her young lady's going off
alone on any such quest. It appeared, she
said, as if the se&ntilde;orita had left her excellent
intelligence behind in Havana. These people
would do very well now; they had food; they
had, indeed, all there was, practically, and
the se&ntilde;orita might herself starve, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
did not find Don Carlos soon. That was
enough, surely; let them remain as they were.</p>

<p>"You are right, Manuela!" said Rita, nodding
sagely. "We must go together. Your
heart does not appear to be stirred as mine
is; but never mind&mdash;the hungry are fed, and
that is the thing of importance. Farewell,
then, friends! How do they call you, that I
may know how to tell those whom I shall
send?"</p>

<p>The younger woman was named Dolores,
she said. Her husband was Pedro Valdez,
and this old one was his mother. If the
se&ntilde;orita should see Pedro&mdash;if by Heaven's
mercy he should be with the General at this
moment, all would indeed be well. In any
case, their prayers and blessings would go
with the se&ntilde;orita and her valued attendant.</p>

<p>Often and often, the soft Spanish speech of
compliment and ceremony sounded hollow and
artificial in Rita's ears, even though she
had been used to it all her life; but there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
no doubting the sincerity of these earnest and
heartfelt thanks. Her own heart felt very
warm, as she turned, with a final wave of the
hands, to take a last look at the little group
by the earth-hovel.</p>

<p>"We have made a good beginning, Manuela,"
she said. "We have saved three lives, I truly
believe. Now we shall go on with new courage.
I feel, Manuela, that I can do anything&mdash;meet
any foe. Ah! what is that? a snake!
a horrible green snake! I faint, Manuela! I
die&mdash;no, I don't. See, I am the sister of a
soldier, and I am not going to die any more,
when I see these fearful creatures. Manuela,
do you observe? I&mdash;am&mdash;firm; marble,
Manuela, is soft in comparison with me. Ah,
he is gone away. This is a world of peril, my
poor child. Let us hasten on; Carlos waits
for us, though he does not know it."</p>

<p>Talking thus, with much more of the same
kind, Rita pushed on, and Manuela followed
as best she might. Rita had left the parrot's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
cage under charge of Dolores, and carried the
bird on her shoulder, with only a cord fastened
to his leg. Chico was well used to
this, and made no effort to fly away; indeed,
he had reached an age when it was more
comfortable to sit on a soft shoulder and be
fed and petted, than to flutter among strange
trees and find his living for himself; so he
sat still, crooning to himself from time to
time, and cocking his bright yellow eye at his
mistress, to see what she thought of it all.</p>

<p>It was hard work, pushing through the
jungle. The girls' hands were scratched and
torn with brambles; Rita's delicate shoes
were in a sad condition; her dress began to
show more than one jagged rent. Still she
made her way forward, with undaunted zeal,
cheering the weary Manuela with jest and
story. Indeed, the girl seemed thoroughly
transformed, and her Northern cousins, who
had known and loved her even in her wilful
indolence, would hardly have recognised their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Rita in this valiant maiden, who made
nothing of heat, dust, or even scorpions, and
pressed on and on in her quest of her brother.</p>

<p>After an hour of weary walking, the girls
came to a road, or something that passed for
a road. There was no sign of life on it, but
there was something that made them start,
then stop and look at each other. Beside the
rough path, in a tangle of vines and thorny
cactus, stood the ruin of a tiny chapel. A
group of noble palms towered above it; from
the stony bank behind it bubbled a little
fountain. The door of the chapel was gone;
it was long since there had been glass in the
windows, and the empty spaces showed only
emptiness within; yet the bell still hung in
the mouldering belfry; the bell-rope trailed
above the sunken porch, its whole length
twined with flowering creepers. It was a
strange sight.</p>

<p>"Manuela!" cried Rita; "do you see?"</p>

<p>"I see the holy chapel," said Manuela,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
who was a good Catholic. "Some saintly
man lived here in old times. Pity, that the
altar is gone. It must have been a pretty
chapel, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>"The bell!" cried Rita. "Do you see the
bell, Manuela? what if we rang it, to let
Carlos know that we are near? It is a good
idea, a superb idea!"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita, I implore you not to touch it!
For heaven's sake, se&ntilde;orita! Alas, what have
you done?"</p>

<p>Manuela clasped her hands, and fairly
wailed in terror, for Rita had grasped the
bell-rope, and was pulling it with right good
will. Ding! ding! the notes rang out loud
and clear. The rock behind caught up the
echo, and sent it flying across to the hill
beyond. Ding! ding! The parrot screamed,
and Rita herself, after sounding two or three
peals, dropped the rope, and stood with
parted lips and anxious eyes, waiting to see
what would come of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP AMONG THE HILLS.</h3>


<p>A sound of voices! eager voices of men,
calling to one another. The tread of hasty
feet, the noise of breaking bushes, of men
sliding, jumping, running, hurrying, coming
every instant nearer and nearer. What had
Rita done, indeed? Manuela crouched on
the mouldering floor at her mistress's feet,
too terrified even to cry out now; Rita Montfort
drew her dagger, and waited.</p>

<p>Next instant the narrow doorway was
thronged with men; swarthy black-browed
men, ragged, hatless, shoeless, but all armed,
all with rifle cocked, all pressing forward
with eager, wondering looks.</p>

<p>"Who rang the bell? what has happened?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A babel of voices arose; Rita could not
have made herself heard if she would; and,
indeed, for the moment no words came to her
lips. But there was one to speak for her.
Chiquito, the old gray parrot, raised his head
from her shoulder, where he had been quietly
dozing, and flapped his wings, and cried
aloud:</p>

<p>"<i>Viva Cuba Libre! viva Garcia! viva
Gomez! a muerto Espana!</i>" There was a
moment's silence; then the voices broke out
again in wild cries and cheers.</p>

<p>"Ah, the Cuban bird! the parrot of freedom!
Welcome, se&ntilde;orita! You bring us
good luck! Welcome to the Cuban ladies and
their glorious bird! <i>Viva Cuba Libre! viva
Garcia! viva el papageno!</i> long life to the
illustrious lady!"</p>

<p>Rita, herself again, stepped from the
chapel, erect and joyous, holding the parrot
aloft.</p>

<p>"I thank you, brothers!" she said. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
come to seek freedom among you; I am a
daughter of Cuba. Does any among you
know Don Carlos Montfort?"</p>

<p>The babel rose again. Know Don Carlos?
but surely! was he not their captain? Even
now he was at the General's quarters, consulting
him about the movements of the next
day. What joy! what honour for the poor
sons of Cuba to form the escort of the peerless
sister of Don Carlos to headquarters!
But the distance was nothing. They would
carry the se&ntilde;orita and her attendant; they
would make a throne, and transport them as
lightly as if swans drew them. Ah, the fortunate
day! the lucky omen of the blessed
parrot!</p>

<p>They babbled like children, crowding round
Chiquito, extolling his beauty, his wisdom,
the miracle of his timely utterance. Chiquito
seemed to think, for his part, that he had
done enough. He paid no attention to the
blandishments of his ragged admirers, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
turned himself upside down, always a sign of
contempt with him, said "Caramba!" and
would say nothing more.</p>

<p>A little procession was formed, the least
ragged of the patriots leading the way,
Rita and Manuela following. The others
crowded together behind, exclaiming, wondering,
pleased as children with this wonderful
happening. Thus they crossed a ragged
hill, threaded a grove of palms, and finally
came upon an open space, roughly cleared,
in the middle of which stood a tent, with
several rude huts around it. The soldiers
explained with eager gestures. Behold the
tent of the illustrious General. Behold the
dwelling of Don Rodrigo, of Don Uberto, of
Don Carlos; behold, finally, Don Carlos himself,
emerging from the General's tent. The
gallant ragamuffins drew back, and became
on the instant spectators at a play. A slender
young man came out of the tent, evidently
to inquire the meaning of the commo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>tion.
At what he saw he turned apparently
to stone, and stood, cigarette in hand, staring
at the vision before him. But for Rita there
was no hesitation now. Running to her
brother, she threw her arms around his neck
with unaffected joy.</p>

<p>"Carlos!" she cried. "I have come to
you. I had no one else to go to. They
were taking me to the convent, and I would
have died sooner. I have come to you, to
live or die with you, for our country."</p>

<p>Manuela wept; the soldiers were moved to
tears, and brushed their ragged sleeves across
their eyes. But Carlos Montfort did not
weep.</p>

<p>"Rita!" he said, in English, returning his
sister's caress affectionately, but with little
demonstration of joy. "What is the meaning
of this? what induced you&mdash;how could
you do such a thing as this? where do you
come from? how did you find your way?"
And he added to himself, "And what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mischief am I to do with you now you
are here?"</p>

<p>Rita explained hastily; gave a dramatic
sketch of her adventures, not forgetting the
unfortunate peasants, who must, she said, be
rescued that instant from their wretched
plight; and wound up with a vivid description
of the bell-ringing, the gathering of
the patriot forces, and the magnificent behaviour
of her beloved Chiquito.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! you have brought the
parrot, too!" cried poor Carlos. "Rita!
Rita! this is too much."</p>

<p>At this moment a new person appeared on
the scene. A tall old man, stooping his head,
came out from the tent, and greeted the wandering
damsel with grave courtesy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the General had seen too much of
life and of war to be surprised at anything;
perhaps he was sorry for the embarrassment
of his young lieutenant, and wished to make
things easier for him; however it was, he ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>parently
found it the most natural thing in
the world for a young lady and her maid to
be wandering in the wilderness in search of
the Cuban army. The first thing, he said,
was to make the se&ntilde;orita comfortable, as
comfortable as their limited powers would
allow. She would take his tent, of course;
it was her own from that instant; but
equally of course neither Rita nor Carlos
would hear of this. A friendly dispute ensued;
and it was finally decided that Rita and
Manuela were to make themselves as comfortable
as might be in Carlos's own tent,
while he shared that of his commander. The
General yielded only under protest to this
arrangement; yet he did yield, seeing that
resistance would distress both brother and
sister. Since the se&ntilde;orita would not take his
tent, he said, the next best thing was that she
should accept his hospitality, such as he could
offer her, within it; or rather, before it, since
the evening was warm. His men were even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
now preparing the evening meal; when the
se&ntilde;orita was refreshed and rested, he hoped
she and Don Carlos would share it with him.</p>

<p>Rita withdrew into the little hut, in a glow
of patriotism and enthusiasm. "Manuela,"
she cried, "did you ever see such nobleness,
such lofty yet gracious courtesy? Ah! I knew
he was a man to die for. How happy we
are, to be here at last, after dreaming of it
so long! I thrill; I burn with sacred fire&mdash;what
is the matter, Manuela? you look the
spirit of gloom. What has happened?"</p>

<p>Manuela was crouching on the bare earthen
floor, her shoulders shrugged up to her ears,
her dark eyes glancing around the tiny room
with every expression of marked disapproval.
It was certainly not a luxurious apartment.
The low walls were of rough logs, the roof was
a ragged piece of very dingy canvas, held in
place by stones here and there. In one corner
was a pile of dried grass and leaves, with
a blanket thrown over it,&mdash;evidently Don<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Carlos's bed. There was a camp-stool, a
rude box set on end, that seemed to do
duty both for dressing and writing table,
since it was littered with papers, shaving
materials, cigarette-cases, and a variety of
other articles.</p>

<p>Manuela spread out her arms with a despairing
gesture. Was this, she asked, the
place where the se&ntilde;orita was going to live?
Where was she to hang the dresses? where
was she to lay out the dressing things? As to
making up the bed,&mdash;it would be better
to die at once, in Manuela's opinion, than to
live&mdash;Here Manuela stopped suddenly, for
she had seen something. Rita, whose back
was turned to the doorway of the hut, was
rating her severely. Was this Manuela's
patriotism, she wished to know? had she not
said, over and over again, that she was prepared
to shed the last drop of blood for their
country, as she herself, Rita, was longing to
do? and now, when it was simply a question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of a little discomfort, of a few privations
shared with their brave defenders, here was
Manuela complaining and fretting, like a
peevish child. Well! and what was the
matter now?</p>

<p>Manuela had risen from her despairing
position, and was now bustling about the hut,
brushing, smoothing, tidying up, with an
air of smiling alacrity. But indeed, yes! she
said; the se&ntilde;orita put her to shame. If the
se&ntilde;orita could endure these trials, it was
not for her poor Manuela to complain. No,
indeed, sooner would she die. And after all,
the hut was small, but that made things more
handy, perhaps. The beautiful table that
this would become, if she might remove the
Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos's cigar-ashes? There! a scarf
thrown over it&mdash;ah! What fortune, that she
had brought the crimson satin scarf! Behold,
an exhibition of beauty! As for the bed,
she had heard from&mdash;from those who were
soldiers themselves, that no couch was so soft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
so wooing to sleep, as one of forest boughs.
It stood to reason; there was poetry in the
thought, as the se&ntilde;orita justly remarked.
Now, with a few nails or pegs to hang things
on, their little apartment would be complete.
Let the se&ntilde;orita of her goodness forget the
foolishness of her poor Manuela; she should
hear no more of it; that was a promise.</p>

<p>Rita looked in amazement at her follower;
the girl's eyes were sparkling, her cheeks
flushed, and she could not keep back the
smiles that came dimpling and rippling over
her pretty face.</p>

<p>"But what has happened to you, Manuela?"
cried Rita. "I insist upon knowing. What
have you seen?"</p>

<p>What had Manuela seen, to produce such
a sudden and amazing change? Nothing,
surely; or next to nothing. A ragged soldier
had strolled past the door of the hut; a
black-browed fellow, with a red handkerchief
tied over his head, and a black cigar nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a foot long; but what should that matter to
Manuela?</p>

<p>Rita looked at her curiously, but could
get no explanation, save that Manuela had
come to her senses, owing to the noble
and glorious example set her by her beloved
se&ntilde;orita.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Rita, turning away half-petulantly.
"Of course I know you are as
changeable as a weathercock, Manuela. But
as you were saying, if we had a few nails, we
should do well enough here. I will go ask
the Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, dearest se&ntilde;orita!" cried Manuela,
hastily. "But what a pity that would be,
to disturb the se&ntilde;or during his arduous labours.
Without doubt the illustrious Se&ntilde;or Don
Generalissimo (Manuela loved a title, and
always made the most of one) requires him
every instant, in the affairs of the nation.
I&mdash;I can find some one who will get nails
for us, and drive them also."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can find some one?" repeated
Rita. "And whom, then, can you find,
pray?"</p>

<p>"Only Pepe!" said Manuela, in a small
voice.</p>

<p>Was the name a conjuring-spell? It had
hardly been spoken when Pepe himself stood
in the doorway, ducking respectfully at the
se&ntilde;orita, but looking out of the corners of his
black eyes at Manuela. Rita smiled in spite
of herself. Was this ragamuffin, barefoot,
tattered, his hair in elf-locks,&mdash;was this
the once elegant Pepe, the admired of himself
and all the waiting-maids of Havana? He
had once been Carlos's servant, when the
young Cuban had time and taste for such idle
luxuries; now he was his fellow soldier and
faithful follower.</p>

<p>"Well, Pepe," said Rita; "you also are
here to welcome us, it appears. That is well.
If you could find us a few nails, my good
Pepe? the Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos is occupied with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the General at present, and you can help us,
if you will."</p>

<p>Where had Rita learned this new and
gracious courtesy? A few months ago, she
would have said, "Pepe! drive nails!" and
thought no more about it. Indeed, she could
have given no explanation, save that "things
were different." Perhaps our Rita is growing
up, inside as well as outside? Certainly
the pretty airs and graces have given way to
a womanly and thoughtful look not at all
unbecoming to any face, however beautiful.</p>

<p>The thoughtful look deepened into anxiety,
as a sudden recollection flashed into her
mind. "Oh!" she cried. "And here I sit
in peace, and have done nothing about those
poor creatures in the hut! I must go to the
General! But stay! Pepe, do you know&mdash;is
there a man in the camp called Pedro
Valdez?"</p>

<p>But, yes! Pepe said. Assuredly there was
such a man. Did the se&ntilde;orita require him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, please bring him!" said Rita. "Tell
him that I have something of importance to
tell him. Quick, my good Pepe!"</p>

<p>Pepe vanished, and soon returned, dragging
by the collar a lean scarecrow even
more dilapidated than himself. Apparently
the poor fellow had been asleep, and had been
roughly clutched and hauled across the camp,
for his hair was full of leaves and grass, and
he was rubbing his eyes and swearing softly
under his breath, vowing vengeance on his
captor.</p>

<p>"Silence, animal!" said Pepe, admonishing
him by a kick of the presence of ladies;
"Behold the illustrious se&ntilde;orita, who does
you the honour to look at you. Attention,
Swine of the Antilles!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, poor Pedro straightened
himself, made the best bow he could, and
stood sheepishly before Rita, trying furtively
to brush a few of the sticks and straws off
his ragged clothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are Pedro Valdez?" asked Rita.</p>

<p>At the service of the illustrious se&ntilde;orita.
Yes, he was Pedro Valdez; in no condition
to appear in such company, but nevertheless
her slave and her beast of burden.</p>

<p>"Oh, listen!" cried Rita, her eyes softening
with compassion and anxiety. "You have
a wife, Pedro Valdez,&mdash;a wife and a dear
little child, is it not so? and your mother&mdash;she
is old and weak. When have you seen
them all, Valdez? Where did you leave
them?"</p>

<p>The man looked bewildered. "Leave
them, se&ntilde;orita? I left them at home, in
our village. They were well, all was well,
when I came away. Has anything befallen
them?"</p>

<p>"They are safe! All is well with them
now, or will be well, when you go to them.
They are near here, Valdez. The Spaniards
broke up the village, do you see? Dolores
and your mother fled with the little one. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
village was burned, and many souls perished;
but Dolores was so strong, so brave, that
she got the old mother away alive and safe,
and the child as well. They have suffered
terribly, my poor man; you must look to find
them pale and thin, but they are alive, and
all will be well when once they have found
you."</p>

<p>Seeing Valdez overcome for the moment,
Rita hastened to the General's tent and told
her story, begging that the husband and
father might be allowed to go at once to the
relief of his suffering family.</p>

<p>"And he shall bring them here, shall he
not?" she cried, eagerly. "They cannot be
separated again, can they, dear Se&ntilde;or General?
you will make room for Dolores&mdash;that is the
wife; oh, such a brave woman! and the old
mother, and the dear little child!"</p>

<p>The General looked puzzled; a look half
quizzical, half sad, stole over his fine face;
while he hesitated, Carlos broke out hastily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"Rita! you are too unreasonable! Do you
think we are in a city here? do you think the
General has everything at his command, to
maintain an establishment of women and
children? It is not to be thought of. We
have no room, no supplies, no conveniences of
any kind; they must go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"They can have my house!" cried Rita,
"Your house, brother Carlos, which you have
given to me. I will sleep in a hammock,
under a tree. What matter? I will live on
bread and water; I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady!" said the General,
interrupting her eager speech with a lifted
hand. "My dear child, if an old man may
call you so, if only we had bread for all,
there would be no further question. We
would gladly take these poor people, and
hundreds of other suffering ones who fill
the hills and valleys of our unhappy country.
But&mdash;Carlos is right, alas! that I must say
it. Here in the mountain camp, it is impossi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ble
for us to harbour refugees, unless for a
night or so, while other provision is making.
Let Valdez bring his family here for the
night&mdash;we can make shift to feed and
shelter them so long. After that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly. Rita clasped her
hands in distress. To be brought face to face
with the impossible was a new experience to
the spoiled child. There was a moment's
silence. Then:</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or General," she cried, "I know! I
see! all may yet be managed. They shall go
to our house."</p>

<p>"To&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To our house, Carlos's and mine, in Havana.
There are servants, troops of them; there is
food, drink, everything, in abundance, in
wicked, shameful abundance. Julio shall take
care of them; Julio shall treat them as his
mother and his sister. I will write commands
to him; this instant I will write."</p>

<p>Snatching a sheet of paper from the table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
she wrote furiously for a moment, then handed
the paper to the General with a look of satisfaction.
The General&mdash;oh, how slow he
was!&mdash;adjusted his glasses, and read the
paper carefully; looked at Rita; looked at
Carlos, and read the paper again. Rita
clenched her little hands, but was calm as
marble, as she assured herself. "Have I the
se&ntilde;orita's permission to read this aloud?"
asked the old man at last. "It may be
that Don Carlos's advice&mdash;a thousand thanks,
se&ntilde;orita." He read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Julio:</span>&mdash;The bearer of this is the wife of
Pedro Valdez. You are to take her and her
family in, and give them the best the house
contains; the best, do you hear? put them
in the marble guest-chamber, and place the
house at their disposal. Send for Doctor
Blanco to attend them; let Teresa wait upon
them, and let her furnish them with clothes
from my wardrobe. If you do not do all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
this, Julio, I will have you killed; so fail
not as you value your life.</p>

<div class='right'>
"<span class="smcap">Margarita de San Real Montfort.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"P.S. The Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos is here with
me, and echoes what I say. We are with the
brave General Sevillo, and if you dare to
disobey, terrible revenge will be taken."</p><br /><br /></div>

<p>"The ardent patriotism of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'senorita'">se&ntilde;orita</ins>,"
said the General, cautiously, "is beautiful and
inspiring; nevertheless, is it not possible that
a more conciliatory tone might&mdash;I would
not presume to dictate, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Rita!" cried Carlos. "Child, when
will you learn that we are no longer acting
plays at home? This is absurd!"</p>

<p>With an impatient movement that might
have been Rita's own, he snatched the paper
and tore it in two. "The General cannot be
troubled with such folly!" he said, shortly.
"Go to your room, my sister, and repose
yourself after your fatigues."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"By no means!" cried the kindly General,
seeing Rita's eyes fill with tears of anger and
mortification. "The se&ntilde;orita has promised
to make my tea for me this evening. Give
orders, I pray you, Don Carlos, that Valdez
bring his family to us for the night; the rest
can well wait for to-morrow's light. The
se&ntilde;orita is exhausted, I fear, with her manifold
fatigues, and she must have no more
anxieties to-day. Behold the tea at this
moment! Se&ntilde;orita Rita, this will be the
pleasantest meal I have had since I left my
home, two years ago."</p>

<p>No anger could stand against the General's
smile. In a moment Rita was smiling herself,
though the tears still stood in her dark eyes,
and one great drop even rolled down her
cheek, to the General's great distress. Carlos,
seeing with contrition his sister's effort at
self-control, bent to kiss her cheek and murmur
a few affectionate words. Soon they
were all seated around the little table, Rita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and the General on camp-stools, Carlos on a
box. The tea was smoking hot; what did
it matter that the nose of the teapot was
broken? Rita had never tasted anything so
delicious as that cup of hot tea, without milk,
and with a morsel of sugar-cane for sweetening.
The camp fare, biscuits soaked in water
and fried in bacon fat, was better, she declared,
than any food she had ever tasted in
her life. To her delight, a small box of
chocolate still remained in her long-suffering
bag; this she presented to the General with
her prettiest courtesy, and he vowed he was
not worthy to taste such delicacies from such
a hand. So, with interchange of compliments,
and with a real friendliness that was far better,
the little feast went on gaily; and when, late
in the evening, Rita withdrew to her tent,
she told Manuela that she had never enjoyed
anything so much in her life; never!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>TO MARGARET.</h3>


<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Camp of the Sons of Cuba</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">May the &mdash;, Midnight.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Marguerite</span>:&mdash;What will you say
when your eyes, those calm gray eyes, rest
upon the above heading? Will they open
wider, I ask myself? Will the breath come
quicker between those cool rose-leaves of your
lips? "It is true!" you will murmur to yourself.
"She has done as she said, as she swore
she would. My Rita, my wild pomegranate
flower, has kept her vow; she is in the
mountains with Carlos; she has taken her
place beside the defenders of her country."</p>

<p>Ah! you thought it was play, Marguerite,
confess it! You thought the wild Cuban girl
was uttering empty breath of nothingness;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you have had no real anxiety, you never
dreamed that I should really find myself&mdash;where
now I am. Where is it? Listen,
Marguerite! My house&mdash;once Carlos's house,
now mine by his brotherly gift&mdash;stands in
a little glen of the hills. An open space,
once dry grass, now bare earth, baked by the
sun, trodden by many feet; a cluster of palms,
a mountain spring gushing from a rock hard
by; on every side hills, the brown, rugged
hills of Cuba, fairer to me than cloudy Alps
of Italy, or those other great mountains of
which never can I remember the barbarous
names. To teach me geography, Marguerite,
you never could succeed, you will remember;
more than our poor Peggy history. Poor
little Peggy! I could wish she were here
with me; it would be the greatest pleasure
of her life. For you, Marguerite, the scene
is too wild, too stern; but Peggy has a
martial spirit under her somewhat clumsy
exterior. But I wander, and Peggy is without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
doubt sleeping at this moment under the
stern eye of her schoolmistress. I began to
tell you about my house, Marguerite. So
small a house you saw never. Standing, I
reach up my hand and touch the roof, of
brown canvas, less fresh than once it was.
Sitting, I stretch out my arms&mdash;here is one
wall; there&mdash;almost, but a few feet between&mdash;is
the other. In a corner my bed&mdash;ah,
Marguerite! on your white couch there, with
snowy draperies falling softly about you,
consider my bed! a pile of dried grasses and
leaves, shaken and tossed anew every morning,
covered with a camp blanket. I tell you,
the gods might sleep on it, and ask no better.
In another corner sleeps Manuela, my faithful
maid, my humble friend, the companion of my
wanderings. Some day you shall see Manuela;
she is an excellent creature. Cultivated, no;
intellinctual&mdash;what is that for a word, Marguerite?
Ah! when will you learn Spanish,
that I may pour my soul with freedom?&mdash;no;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but a heart of gold, a spirit of fire and crystal.
She keeps my hut neat, she arranges my
toilet,&mdash;singular toilets, my dear, yet not
wholly unbecoming, I almost fancy,&mdash;she
helps me in a thousand ways. She has a
little love-affair, that is a keen interest to me;
Pepe, formerly the servant of Carlos, adores
her, and she casts tender eyes upon the young
soldier. For me, as you know, Marguerite,
these things are for ever past, buried in the
grave of my hero, in the stately tomb that
hides the ashes of the Santillos. I take a
sorrowful pleasure in watching the budding
happiness of these young creatures. More
of this another time.</p>

<p>I sit, Marguerite, in the doorway of my
little house. It is the middle hour of the
night, when tomb-yards gape, as your Shakespeare
says. Am I sleepy? No! The camp
slumbers, but I&mdash;I am awake, and I watch.
I had a very long siesta, too. The moon is
full, and the little glade is bathed in silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
light. Here in Cuba, Marguerite, the moon
is other than with you in the north. You
call her pale moon, gentle moon, I know not
what. Here she shines fiercely, with passion,
with palpitations of fiery silver. The palms,
the aloes, the tangled woods about the camp,
are black as night; all else is a flood of airy
silver. I float, I swim in this flood, entranced,
enraptured. I ask myself, have I lived till
now? is not this the first real thrill of life
I have ever experienced? I alone wake, as
I said; the others slumber profoundly. The
General in his tent; ah, that you could know
him, Marguerite! that you and my uncle
could embrace this noble, this godlike figure!
He is no longer young, the snows of seventy
winters have blanched his clustering locks;
it is the only sign of age. For the rest, erect,
vigorous, a knight, a paladin, a&mdash;in effect,
a son of Cuba. The younger officers regard
him as a divinity; they live or die at his
command. They are three, these officers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Carlos is one; the others, Don Alonzo Ximenes,
Don Uberto Cortez. Don Alonzo is not
interesting; he is fat, and rather stupid, but
most good-natured. Don Uberto is Carlos's
friend, a noble young captain, much admired
formerly in Havana. I have danced with
him, my cousin, in halls of rose-wreathed
marble; we meet here in the wilderness, I
with my shattered affections, he with his
country's name written on his soul. It is
affecting; it is heart-stirring, Marguerite; yet
think nothing of it; romance is dead for
Margarita Montfort. Carlos is my kind
brother, as ever. He was vexed at first at
my coming here. Heavens! what was I to
do? My stepmother was dragging me to a
convent; my days would have been spent
there, and in a short time my life would have
gone out like a flame. "Out, short candle!"
You see I remember your Shakespeare readings,
my dearest. Can I forget anything
that recalls you to me, half of my heart? If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
there had been time, indeed, I might have
written to my uncle; I might even have come
to you; but the hour descended like a thunderbolt;
I fled, Manuela with me. The manner
of my flight? you will ask. Marguerite, it
was managed&mdash;I do not boast, I am the soul
of humility, you know it!&mdash;the manner of
it was perfect. Listen, and you shall hear
all. You remember that in my last
letter&mdash;written, alas! in my beloved garden, which
I may never see more&mdash;I spoke with a certain
restraint, even an approach to mystery.
It was thus. At first, when that woman
proposed to take me to the convent, I was
a creature distracted. The fire of madness
burned in my veins, and I could think of
nothing save death or revenge. But with
time came reflection; came wisdom, Marguerite,
and inflexible resolve. To those she
loves, Margarita Montfort is wax, silk, down,
anything the most soft and yielding that can
be figured. To her enemies, steel and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
adamant are her composition. I had two
friends in that house of Spaniards; one was
Pasquale, good, faithful Pasquale, an under
gardener and helper; the other, Manuela, my
maid. I have described her to you&mdash;enough!
I realised that action must be of swiftness,
the lightning flash, the volcano fire that I
predicted. Do not say that I did not warn
you, Marguerite; knowing me, you must have
expected from my last letter what must come.
I called Manuela to my room, I made
pretence that she should arrange my hair. My
hair has grown three inches, Marguerite, since
I left you; it now veritably touches the floor
as I sit. Our holy religion tells us that it is
a woman's crown, yet how heavy a one at
times! I closed the door, I locked it; I
caused to draw down the heavy Persians.
Then, tiger-like, I sprang upon my attendant,
and laid my hand on her mouth. "Hush!"
I tell her. "Not a word, not a sound! dare
but breathe, and you may be my death. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
life, I tell you, hangs by a thread. Hush! be
silent, and tell me all. Tell me who assists
Geronimo in the stables since Pablo is ill."
Manuela struggles, she releases herself to
reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pasquale!"</p>

<p>It is the answer from heaven. Pasquale, I
have said, is my one friend beside Manuela.
I say to her, "Do thus, and thus! give these
orders to Pasquale; tell him that it imports of
your life and mine, saying nothing of his own;
that if I am not obeyed, the evil eye will be
the least of his punishments, and death without
the sacraments the end for him."</p>

<p>Manuela hears; she trembles; she flies to
execute my commands. Then, Marguerite&mdash;then,
what does the daughter of Cuba do? She
goes to the wall, to the trophy I have described
to you so often. She selects her weapons. Ah,
if you could see them! First, a long slender
dagger, the steel exquisitely inlaid with gold,
in a sheath of green enamel; a dagger for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a prince, Marguerite, for your Lancelot or
Tristram! Another, short and keen, the blade
plain but deadly, cased in wrought leather of
Cordova. Last, my machete, my pearl of
destructiveness. It was his, my Santayana's;
he procured it from Toledo, from the master
sword-maker of the universe. The blade is
so fine, the eye refuses to tell where it melts
into the air; a touch, and the hardest substance
is divided exactly in two pieces. The
handle, gold, set with an ancestral emerald,
which for centuries has brought victory in
the field to the arm of the hero who wore it;
the sheath&mdash;I forget myself; this weapon
has no sheath. When a Santillo de Santayana
rides into battle, he has no thought to sheathe
his sword. These, Marguerite, are my armament;
these, and a tiny gold-mounted revolver,
a gem, a toy, but a toy of deadly purpose.
Enough! I lay them apart, ready for the
night. I go to my stepmother, I smile, I
make submission. I will do all she wishes;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I am a child; her age impresses me with the
truth that I should not set my will against
hers. Concepcion is thirty on her next birthday;
she tells the world that she is twenty,
but I know! it grinds her bones when I
remind her of her years, as they were revealed
to me by a member of her family. So! She
is pleased, we embrace, the volantes are commanded,
all goes smoothly. I demand permission
to take my parrot to the convent; it
is, to my surprise, accorded; I know she
thought those savage sisters would kill him
the first time he uttered his noble and inspiring
words.</p>

<p>The night comes, the hour of the departure.
To accompany us goes my good Don
Miguel, the dear old man of whom I have
told you, whom I revere as my grandfather.
My heart yearns to tell him all, to cast myself
on his venerable bosom and cry, "Come
with me; take me yourself to my brother;
share with us the perils and glories of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tented field!" But no! he is old, this dear
friend; his hair is the snow, his step is feeble.
Hardships such as Rita must now endure
would end his feeble life. I speak no word;
a marble smile is all I wear, though my heart
is rent with anguish. The carriages are at
the door. Concepcion would have me ride
in the first, that she may have her eyes on
me at each instant. She suspects nothing,
no; it is merely the base and suspicious
nature which reveals itself at every occasion.
I refuse, I prodigate expressions of my
humility, of my determination to take the
second place, leaving the first to her; briefly,
I take the second volante, Manuela springing
to my side. After some discontent, appeased
by dear Don Miguel, who is veritably an
angel, and wants but death to transport him
among the saints, Concepcion mounts in the
first volante. I have seen that Pasquale is
on the box of mine; I possess my soul, I lean
back and count the beats of my fevered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
pulse, as we ascend the steep road, winding
among hills and forests. The convent is at
the top of a long, long hill, very steep and
rugged; the horses pant and strain; humanity
demands that they slacken their pace,
that the carriages are slowly, slowly, drawn
up the rugged track. The night descends, I
have told you, swiftly in our southern climate;
already it is dark. On either side of
the road are tall shrouded forms, which
Manuela takes for sentinels, for Spanish soldiers
drawn up to watch, perhaps to arrest us.
I laugh; I see they are the aloes only,
planted here in rows along the road. Presently,
at a turn of the road, a light! a fire
burning by the roadside, and soldiers running,
real ones this time, to the horses'
heads. "<i>Alerta! quien va?</i>" It is the Spanish
challenge, Marguerite; it is a piquette of
the Gringos, of the hated Spaniards. They
peer into the carriages, faces of savages, of
brutes, devils; I feel their glances like poi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>soned
arrows. They demand, Don Miguel
makes answer, shows his papers. Of the instant
these slaves are cringing, are bowing to
the earth. "Pass, most honourable and illustrious
Se&ntilde;or Don Miguel Pietoso, with the
heavenly ladies under your charge!" It is
over. The volantes roll on. I clasp Manuela
in my arms and whisper, "We are free!"
We mingle our tears of rapture, but for a
moment only. We approach the steepest
pitch of the long hill (it is veritably a mountain),
a place beyond conception rugged and
difficult. The horses strain and tug; they
are at point of exhaustion. I look at Pasquale;
Pasquale has served me since my
cradle. Does his head move, a very little,
the least imaginable motion? It is too dark
to see; the moon is not yet risen. But I feel
the horses checked, I feel the carriage pause,
an instant, a breath only. I step noiselessly
to the ground; the volante is low, permitting
this without danger. Manuela follows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
There is not a sound, not a creak, not the
rustle of a fold. Again it is over. The volante
rolls on. Manuela and I are alone,
are free in the mountains of Cuba Libre.</p>

<p>I have but one thought: my country, my
brother! Behold me here, in the society of
one, prepared to shed my blood for the other.
You would never guess who else is with us;
Chiquito, our poor old friend the parrot, the
sacred legacy of that white saint, our departed
aunt. Could I leave him behind, to
unfriendly, perhaps murderous, hands? Old
Julio is a Spaniard at heart; Chiquito is a
Cuban bird; his very soul&mdash;do you doubt
that a bird has a soul, when I tell you that
I have seen it in his eyes, Marguerite?&mdash;his
very soul speaks for his country. If you
could hear him cry, "<i>Viva Cuba Libre!</i>" The
camp is on fire when they hear him. Ah,
they are such brave fellows, our soldiers!
poor, in rags, half-fed&mdash;it matters not! each
one is a hero, and all are my brothers. Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>guerite,
sleep hangs at last upon me. Good-night,
beloved; good-night, cool white soul of
ivory and silver. I love thee always devotedly.
Have no fear for me. It is true that
the Spaniards are all about us in these mountains,
that at any moment we may be attacked.
What of that? If the daughter of
Cuba dies by her brother's side, in her country's
cause, my Marguerite will know that it
is well with her. You will shed a tear over
the lonely grave among the Cuban hills; but
you will plant a wreath for Rita, a wreath
of mingled laurel and immortelle, and it will
bloom eternally.</p>

<p>Ever, and with a thousand greetings to my
honoured and admired uncle, your</p>

<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Margarita de San Real Montfort.</span><br /></div><p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>IN THE NIGHT.</h3>


<p>Rita drew a long breath as she folded
her letter. She was in a fine glow of mingled
affection and patriotic fervour; it had been a
great relief to pour it all out in Margaret's
sympathetic ear, though that ear were a
thousand miles away. Now she really must
go to bed. It was one o'clock, her watch
told her. It seemed wicked, profane, to
sleep under such moonlight as this; but still,
the body must be preserved.</p>

<p>"But first," she said to herself, "I must
have a drop of water; writing so long has
made me thirsty."</p>

<p>She took up the earthen water-jar, but
found it empty. Pepe had for once been
faithless; indeed, neither he nor Manuela had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
escaped the witchery of the full moon, and
she had had little good of them that whole
evening. She glanced at the corner where
Manuela lay; the light, regular breathing
told that the girl was sound asleep. It
would be a pity to wake her from her first
sweet sleep, poor Manuela. A year, perhaps
a month ago, Rita would not have hesitated
an instant; but now she murmured, "Sleep,
little one! I myself will fetch the water."</p>

<p>She stepped out into the moonlight, with
the jar in her hand. All was still as sleep
itself. No sound or motion from huts or
tent. Under the palms lay a number of
brown bundles, motionless. Dry leaves, piled
together for burning? no! soldiers of Cuba,
wrapped in such covering as they could find,
taking their rest. Alone, beside a little heap
of twigs that still smouldered, the sentry sat;
his back was turned to her. Should she
speak to him, and ask him to go to the
spring for her? No; how much more interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ing
to go herself! Everything looked so different
in this magic light; it was a whole
new world, the moon's fairyland; who knew
what wonderful sights might meet her eyes?
Besides, her old nurse used to say that water
drawn from a pure spring under the full
moon produced a matchless purity of the
complexion. Her complexion was well
enough, perhaps, but still&mdash;and anyhow,
it would be an adventure, however small a
one.</p>

<p>The girl's feet, in their soft leather slippers,
made no sound on the bare earth. The sentry
did not turn his head. Silent as a cloud, she
stole across the little glade, and passed under
the trees at the farther end. Here the
ground broke off suddenly in a rocky pitch,
down which one scrambled to another valley
or glen lying some hundred feet lower; the
cliff (for it was steep enough to merit that
name) was mostly bare rock, but here and
there a little earth had caught and lodged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and a few seeds had dropped, and a tuft of
grass or a little tree had sprung up, defying
the gulf below. A few feet only from the
upper level, just below a group of palms that
nodded over the brink, the stream gushed
out from the face of the rock, clear and cold.
The soldiers had hollowed a little trough to
receive the trickling stream, and one had
only to hold one's pitcher under this spout
for a few minutes, to have it filled with delicious
water. Rita had often come hither in
the daytime, during the week that had now
passed since her arrival at the mountain
camp. It was a wild and picturesque scene
at any time, but now the effect of the intense
white light, falling on splintered rock, hanging
tree, and glancing stream was magical indeed.
Rita lay down on her face at the edge
of the precipice, as she had seen the soldiers
do, and lowered her jar carefully. As the
water gurgled placidly into the jar, her eyes
roved here and there, taking in every detail of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the marvellous scene before her. Never, she
thought, had she seen anything so beautiful,
so unearthly in its loveliness. Peace! silver
peace, and silence, the silence of&mdash;hark!
what was that?</p>

<p>A crack, as of a twig breaking; a rustling,
far below in the gorge; a shuffling sound, as
of soft shod feet pressing the soft earth.
Rita crouched flat to the ground, and, leaning
over as far as she dared, peered over the
precipice. The bottom of the gorge was
filled with a mass of tall grasses and feathery
blossoming shrubs, with here and there a
tree rising tall and straight. The leaves
were black as jet in the strong light. Gazing
intently, she saw the branches tremble, wave,
separate; and against the dark leaves shone
a gleam of metal, that moved, and came
nearer. Another and yet another; and now
she could see the dark faces, and the moon
shone on the barrels of the carbines, and made
them glitter like silver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftly and noiselessly the girl drew back
from the brink, crouching in the grass till
she reached the shadow of the grove. Then
she rose to her feet, still holding her jar of
water carefully,&mdash;for there was no need of
wasting that,&mdash;and ran for her life.</p>

<p>A whispered word to the sentry, who
sprang quickly enough from his reverie beside
the fire; then to the General's tent, then
to Carlos, with the same whispered message.
"The Gringos are here! Wake, for the love
of Heaven!"</p>

<p>In another moment the little glade was
alive with dusky figures, springing from
their beds of moss and leaves, snatching
their arms, fumbling for cartridges. The
General was already among them. Carlos
and the other officers came running, buckling
their sword-belts, rubbing their eyes.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" all were asking in
excited whispers. "Who saw them? Is it
another nightmare of Pepe's?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! no!" murmured Rita. "I saw them,
I tell you! I saw their faces in the moonlight.
I went to get some water. They are
climbing up the cliff. I did not stop to count,
but there must be many of them, from the
sound of their feet. Oh, make haste, make
haste!"</p>

<p>The General gave his orders in a low, emphatic
tone. Twenty men, with Carlos at
their head, glided like shadows across the
glade, and disappeared among the trees.
Rita's breath came quick, and she prepared to
follow; but the old General laid a kind hand
on her arm. "No, my child!" he said.
"You have done your country a great service
this night. Do not imperil your life needlessly.
Go rather to your room, and pray for
your brother and for us all."</p>

<p>But prayer was far from Rita's thoughts at
that moment. "Dear General," she implored,
with clasped hands, the tears starting to her
eyes, "Let me go! let me go! I implore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
you! I will pray afterward, I truly will. I
will pray while I am fighting, if you will
only let me go. See! I have come all this
way to fight for my country; and must I
stay away from the first battle? Look, dear
Se&ntilde;or General! Look at my machete! Isn't
it beautiful? it is the sword of a hero; I must
use it for him. Let me go!" The beautiful
face, upturned in the moonlight, the dark eyes
shining through their tears, might have softened
a harder heart than that of General
Sevillo. He opened his lips to reply, his
fatherly hand still on her arm, when suddenly
a sharp report was heard. A single
shot, then a volley, the shots rattling out,
struck back and forth from cliff to cliff, multiplying
in hideous echoes. Then broke out
cries and groans; the crash of heavy bodies
falling back among the trees below, and
shouts of "<i>Viva Cuba;</i>" and still the shots
rang out, and still the echoes cracked and
snapped. Rita turned pale as death, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
clasped her hands on her bosom. "<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Dios!</i>" she cried. "I had forgotten; there
will be blood!" and rushing into her hut, she
flung herself face downward on her leafy bed.</p>

<p>The perplexed General looked after her for
a moment, pulling his grizzled moustache.
"<i>Caramba!</i>" he muttered. "To understand
these feminines? Decidedly, this charming
child must be sent into safety to-morrow."
And shaking his head and shrugging his
shoulders, he strode in the direction of the
firing.</p>

<p>Ten minutes' sharp fighting, and the skirmish
was over. The Spanish "guerilla" was
scattered, many of the guerilleros lying dead
or wounded at the foot of the precipice, the
others scrambling and tumbling down as best
they might. Carlos and his men had so
greatly the advantage in position, if not in
numbers, that not a single Cuban was killed,
though two or three were more or less seriously
wounded. Among these was the un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fortunate
Pedro Valdez, who had only that
evening returned to camp, having left his
child and his old mother in a place of safety.
His wife had been allowed to remain for
a short time in camp, at the request of the
surgeon, as she had had some experience in
nursing. Now he was shot in the arm, and
his comrades lifted him gently, and carried
him back. His wife was waiting for him.
She seemed to have expected something of
the kind, for she made no outcry; she followed
quietly to the clump of trees distant
a little way from the rest of the camp, where
good Doctor Ferrando had the solitary rancho,
the case of surgical instruments and the few
rolls of bandages that constituted his field
hospital. A rough table had been knocked
together for operations; otherwise the sick
and wounded fared much as the rest did,
sleeping on beds of leaves and dry grass, and
fighting the mosquitoes as best they might.
Here the bearers laid Pedro down, and Dolores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
took her place quietly at his side, fanning
away the insects that hovered in clouds about
the wounded man, holding the poor arm while
the doctor dressed it, and behaving as if her
life had been spent in a hospital.</p>

<p>Doctor Ferrando spoke a few words of approval,
but the woman heeded them little; it
was a matter of course that where there was
suffering, she should be at work. So, when
Pedro presently dropped off to sleep, she
moved softly about among the wounded men,
smoothing a blanket here, changing a ligature
there, doing all with light, swift fingers whose
touch healed instead of hurting.</p>

<p>She was sitting beside a lad, the last to be
brought in from the scene of the skirmish,
when the screen of bushes by the rancho
was parted, and Rita appeared. Slowly and
timidly she drew near; her face was like
marble; her eyes looked unnaturally large
and dark. Dolores made a motion to rise,
but a gesture bade her keep her place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" said the young girl. "Sit still,
Dolores! I have come&mdash;to&mdash;to learn!"</p>

<p>"To learn, se&ntilde;orita?" repeated the woman,
humbly. The se&ntilde;orita was in her grateful
eyes a heaven-descended being, whose every
look and word must be law; this new bearing
amazed and puzzled her.</p>

<p>"What can this poor soul teach the noble
and high-born lady?" she asked, sadly. "I
know nothing, not even to read; I am a poor
woman merely. The se&ntilde;or doctor is this
moment gone to take his distinguished siesta;
do I call him for the se&ntilde;orita?"</p>

<p>Rita shook her head, and crept nearer,
gazing with wide eyes of fear at the prostrate
form beside which Dolores was sitting.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="271" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;HUSH!&#39; SAID THE YOUNG GIRL. &#39;SIT STILL.&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;HUSH!&#39; SAID THE YOUNG GIRL. &#39;SIT STILL.&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;HUSH!&#39; SAID THE YOUNG GIRL. &#39;SIT STILL.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"See, Dolores!" she said; and her tone
was as humble as the woman's own. "I
must learn&mdash;to take care of him&mdash;of them!"
She nodded at the sufferer. "All my life,
you see, I could never bear the sight of blood.
To cut my finger, I fainted at the instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Always they said, 'Poor child! it is her
delicacy, her sensibility;' they praised me;
I thought it a fine thing, to faint, to turn
pale at the word even. Now&mdash;oh, Dolores, do
you see? I desire to help my country, my
brother, all the heroes who are risking their life,
are shedding their&mdash;their blood&mdash;for Cuba.
I think I can fight; I forget; I see only the
bright shining blades, the victorious banners; I
forget that these heroes must bleed, that this
horrible blood must flow in streams, in torrents,
that oceans of it must overwhelm us,
the defenders of my country. <i>Ay de mi!</i> I
begged the General even now to let me fight,
to let me stand beside my Carlos, and wield
my beautiful machete. Suddenly, Dolores&mdash;I
heard the shots; I heard&mdash;terrible sounds!
screams&mdash;oh, Dios!&mdash;screams of men, perhaps
of my own brother, in anguish. All at
once it came over me&mdash;I cannot tell you&mdash;I
saw it all, the blood, the wounds, the horror
to death. I awoke from my dreams; I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a child, do you see, Dolores? I was a child,
playing at war, and thinking&mdash;thinking the
thoughts of a silly, silly child. Now I am
awake; now I know&mdash;what&mdash;what war
means. So&mdash;I am foolish, but I can learn;
I think I can learn. You are a brave woman;
I have been watching you through the leaves
for half an hour. I saw you&mdash;I saw you
change those cloths; those terrible bloody
cloths on that poor man's head. At first my
eyes turned round, I saw black only; but I
opened them again, I fixed them on what you
held, I watched. Now I can bear quite well
to look at it. Help me, Dolores! teach me&mdash;to
help as you help; teach me to care for
these brothers, as you do."</p>

<p>Dolores looked earnestly in the beautiful
young face. In spite of the deadly pallor, she
saw that the girl was fully herself, was calm
and determined. With a simple, noble gesture
she lifted Rita's slender hand to her lips,
saying merely: "This hand shall bring bless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>ing
to many! come, my se&ntilde;orita, and see!
it is so easy, when once one knows the way
of it."</p>

<p>Very gently the poor peasant's wife showed
the rich man's daughter the A B C of woman's
work among the sick and suffering. At first
Rita could do little more than control her
own nerves, and fight down the faintness that
came creeping over her at sight of the bandaged
faces, ghastly under the brown, of the
torn flesh and nerveless limbs. Gradually,
however, she began to gain strength. The
rough brown hand moved so easily, so lightly;
it laid hold of those terrible bandages as if
they were mere ordinary bits of linen. Surely
now, she, Rita, could do that too. As Dolores
took a cloth from her husband's head, the
girl's hand was outstretched, took it quietly,
and handed a fresh one to the nurse. The
cloth she took was covered with red stains.
For a moment Rita's head swam, and the
world seemed to turn dark before her eyes;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but she held the thing firmly, till her sight
cleared again; then dropped it in the tub of
water that stood ready, and taking up the
fan of green palm-leaf, swept it steadily to
and fro, driving the clouds of flies and mosquitoes
away from the sufferer.</p>

<p>Coming back from his siesta half an hour
later, good Doctor Ferrando paused a moment
at the entrance of the hospital grove. There
were two nurses now; the good man gazed in
astonishment at the slender figure kneeling
beside one of the rough cots, fanning the
wounded man, and singing in a low, sweet
voice, a song of Cuba. Several of the men
were awake, and gazing at her with delight.
Dolores, with a look of quiet happiness on
her face, sat beside the bed where her husband
was sleeping peacefully. "Come!"
said the doctor, "war, after all, has its beauty
as well as its terror. Observe this heavenly
sight, you benevolent saints!" he waved his
cigar upward, inviting the attention of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
attendant spirits. "Consider this lovely child,
awakened to the holiness of womanhood!
and the General will destroy all this to-morrow,
from respect for worldly conventions!
He is without doubt right; yet, what
a pity!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>CAMP SCENE.</h3>


<p>"If I must, dear Se&ntilde;or General&mdash;I will be
good, I will, indeed; but my heart will break
to leave Carlos, and the camp, and you, Se&ntilde;or
General."</p>

<p>"My dear child,&mdash;my dear young lady,
what pleasure for me to keep you here! the
first sunshine of the war, it came with you,
Se&ntilde;orita Margarita. Nevertheless, duty is
duty; I should be wanting in mine, most wofully
and wickedly wanting, if I allowed you
to remain here, in hourly danger, when a few
hours could place you in comparative safety.
Perfect safety, I do not promise. Where
shall we find it, even for our nearest and
dearest, in this poor distracted country? But
with Don Annunzio and his family you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be safe at least for a time; whereas here&mdash;"
The General looked around, and shrugged
his shoulders, spreading his hands out with
a dramatic gesture. "The Gringos have
learned the way to our mountain camp; they
will not forget it. Another attack may come
any night; our camp is an outpost, placed of
purpose to guard this position, which must
of necessity be one of danger. To have women
with us&mdash;it is not only exposing them to the
terrible possibilities of war, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. "I see!" cried Rita. "I see!
you are too kind to say it, but we are a
burden upon you. We make harder the
work; we are an encumbrance. Dear Se&ntilde;or
General, I go! I fly! Give me half, a quarter
of an hour, and I am gone. Never, never,
will I be in the way of my country's defenders;
never! Too long we have stayed
already; Manuela shall make on the instant
our packets, and in a little hour you shall
forget that we were here at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The good General cried out, "No! no! my
dear child, my dear se&ntilde;orita; cease these
words, I implore you. You cut me to the
heart. Consider the help that you have
brought to us; consider the nursing, the tender
care that you and the wife of Valdez have
given to our sufferers, in the rancho there.
Never will this be forgotten, rest assured
of that. But&mdash;it is true that you must go;
yet not too soon. This evening, when the
coolness falls, Don Carlos, with a chosen
escort, will conduct you to the residence of
Don Annunzio. There, I rejoice to think
that you will find, not luxury, but at least
some few of the comforts of ordinary life.
Here you have suffered; your lofty spirit
will not confess it, but you have&mdash;you must
have suffered, delicate and fragile as you are,
in the rough life of a Cuban camp. Enough!
The day is before you, dearest se&ntilde;orita. I
pray you, while it lasts, make use of me, of
all that the camp contains, in whatever way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
you can imagine. I would make the day a
pleasant one, if I might. Command me, dear
se&ntilde;orita, in anything and everything. The
camp is yours, with all it contains."</p>

<p>He bowed with courtly grace, and Rita
courtsied and then turned quickly away, to
hide the tears that would come in spite of
her. It was a keen disappointment. When
Carlos told her that morning that she must
leave the camp, she had refused pointblank.
A stormy scene followed, in which the old
Rita was only too much in evidence. She
raged, she wept, she stamped her little foot.
She was a Cuban, as much as he was; she
was a nurse, a daughter of the army; no
human power should drive her from the
ground where she was prepared to shed her
last drop of blood for the defenders of her
country. Now&mdash;a few kind, grave words
from a gray-haired man, and all was changed.
She was not a necessity, she was a hindrance;
she saw that this must be so; the pain was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sharp, but she would not show it; she would
never again lose her self-control, never. Carlos
should see that she was no longer a child.
He had called her a child, not half an hour
ago, a naughty child, who was making trouble
for everybody. Well&mdash;Rita stood still; the
thought came over her suddenly,&mdash;it was true!
she had been childish, had been naughty.
Suppose Margaret or Peggy should behave
so, stamping and storming; how would it
seem? Oh, well, that was different. Their
blood was cool, almost cold. It flowed sluggishly
in their veins. She was a child of
the South; it was not to be expected that she
should be like Margaret. Yes! but&mdash;the
thought would come, troubling all her mind;
suppose Margaret were here, with her calm
sense, her cheerful face, and tranquil voice;
would not she be of more use, of more help,
than a girl who could not help screaming
when she was in a passion?</p>

<p>These thoughts were new to Rita Montfort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Full of them, she walked slowly to her hut,
with bent head, and eyes full of unshed tears.
Meanwhile, the good General went back to
his tent, where Carlos awaited him with some
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, as the gray head bent
under the tent-flaps.</p>

<p>"Well," responded his commander. "It
is very well, my son. The se&ntilde;orita&mdash;she is
adorable, do you know it? Never have I seen
a more lovely young person! The se&ntilde;orita
is most reasonable. She comprehends; she
understands the desolation that it is to me
to send away so delightful a visitor;
nevertheless&mdash;she accepts all, with her own
exquisite grace."</p>

<p>Carlos shrugged his shoulders; that same
exquisite grace had flashed a dagger in his
eyes not ten minutes before, vowing that
it should be sheathed in the owner's heart
before she left the camp; but it was not
necessary to say this to the General. Carlos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was an affectionate brother, and was honestly
relieved and glad to find that Rita had come
to her senses. He thanked General Sevillo
warmly for his good offices, and, being off
duty, went in search of his sister, determining
that he would make her last day in camp a
pleasant one, so far as lay in his power. He
found Rita sitting sadly in the door of her
hut, watching Manuela, who was packing
up their belongings, unwillingly enough.
Manuela had enjoyed her stay in camp
greatly, and thought life would be very dull,
in comparison, at Don Annunzio's cottage;
but there was no escape, and the white silk
blouse and the swansdown wrapper went into
the bag with all the other fineries.</p>

<p>"Come, Rita," said Carlos, taking his sister's
hand affectionately; "come with me,
and let me show you some things that you
have not yet seen. You must not forget the
camp. Who knows? Some day you may
come back to pay us a visit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Rita shook her head, and the tears came to
her eyes again; but she drove them back
bravely, and smiled, and laid her hand in her
brother's; and they passed out together
among the palm-trees.</p>

<p>Manuela looked after them, and laid her
hand on her heart; it was a gesture that she
had often seen her mistress use, and it
seemed to her infinitely touching and beautiful.
"<i>Ohim&eacute;</i>," sighed Manuela. "War is terrible,
indeed! To think that we must go
away, just when we are so comfortable. But
where, then, is this idiot? Pepe! When I
call you, will you come, animal? Pepe!"</p>

<p>The thicket near the rancho rustled and
shook, and Pepe appeared. This young man
presented a different figure from the forlorn
one that had greeted the two girls on their
first arrival at the camp. His curly hair was
now carefully brushed and oiled. The scarlet
handkerchief was still tied about his
head, but it was tied now with a grace that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
might have done credit to the most dandified
matador in the Havana ring. His jacket was
neatly mended; altogether, Pepe was once
more a self-respecting, even a
self-admiring youth. Also, he admired Manuela
immensely, and lost no opportunity of telling
that she was the light of his eyes and
the flower of his soul. He was now beginning
some remarks of this description, but
Manuela interrupted him, laying her pretty
brown hand unceremoniously on his lips.</p>

<p>"For once, Pepe, endeavour to possess a
small portion of sense," she said. "Listen
to me! We must leave the camp."</p>

<p>"How then, marrow of my bones! Leave
the camp? You and I?"</p>

<p>"I am speaking to a monkey, then, instead
of a man? The use, I ask you, of addressing
intelligent remarks to such a corporosity?
My mistress and I, simpleton. This General
of yours drives us from his quarters; he
begrudges the morsel we eat, the rude hut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that shelters us. Enough! we go; even now
I make preparation. Pull this strap for me,
Pepe; at least you have strength. Ah! If
I were but a great stupid man, it would be
well with me this day!"</p>

<p>"But well for no one else, my idol," said
Pepe, tugging away at the strap. "Desolation
and despair for the rest of mankind, Rose
of the Antilles. Accidental death to this
bag! why have you filled it so full? There!
it is strapped. Manuela, is it possible that I
live without you? No! I shall fall an easy
victim to the first fever that comes; already
I feel it scorching my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, a paralysis upon you! Can I exercise
my thoughts, with the chatter of a parrot
in my ears? Attend, then, Pepe,&mdash;you will
miss me a little, will you? Just a very
little?"</p>

<p>Pepe opened his mouth for new and fiery
protestations, but was bidden peremptorily to
shut it again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I desire now to hear myself speak," said
Manuela. "I weary, Pepe, for the sound of
my own poor little voice. Listen, then! These
days I have been here, and you have never
asked me what I brought with me for you;
brought all that cruel way from the city. I
knew I should find you somewhere, my good
Pepe; or, if not you, some other friend,
some other good son of Cuba. I thought
of you, I remembered you, even in the
rush of our departure. See! It is yours.
May it bring you fortune!"</p>

<p>She handed him a little packet, neatly
folded in white paper, and tied with a
crimson ribbon. Receiving it with
dramatic eagerness, Pepe opened it and
looked with delight at its contents.</p>

<p>"A <i>detente!</i>" he cried. "Manuela! and
the most beautiful that has been seen upon
the earth. This is not for me! No! Impossible!
The General alone is worthy to wear
this object of an elegance so resplendent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Reassured on this point, he proceeded to
pin the emblem on his jacket, and
contemplated it with delighted pride. It
was a simple thing enough; a square of white
flannel the size of an ordinary needlebook,
neatly scalloped around the edge with white
silk. In the centre was embroidered a crimson
heart, and under it the words, "<i>Detente!
pienso en ti!</i>" ("Be of good cheer! I think
of thee!")</p>

<p>"And did you really think of me, Manuela?"
cried the delighted Pepe. "Did you,
bright and gay, in the splendid city, think of
the lonely soldier?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said Manuela, "when I
had nothing else to do. And now you may
go away, Pepe, I am busy; I cannot attend
to you any longer."</p>

<p>"But," said Pepe, bewildered, "you called
me, Manuela."</p>

<p>"Yes; to strap my bag. It is done; I
thank you. It is finished."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"And&mdash;you have given me the <i>detente</i>,
moon of my soul!"</p>

<p>"Then you cannot complain that I never
gave you anything. And now I give you
one thing more,&mdash;leave to depart. <i>Adios,</i>
Don Pepe!" and she actually shut the door
of the hut in the face of her astonished adorer,
who departed muttering strange things concerning
the changeableness of all women, and
of Manuela in particular.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rita and Carlos were wandering
about the camp, and Rita was seeing, as her
brother promised, some things that were new
to her, even after a stay of nearly a week.
She saw the kitchen, or what passed for a
kitchen,&mdash;a pleasant spot under a palm-tree,
where the cook was even then toasting long
strips of meat over the <i>parilla</i>, a kind of
gridiron, made by simply driving four stakes,
and laying bits of wood across and across
them, then lighting a fire beneath.</p>

<p>"But why does it not burn up, your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<i>parilla?</i>" asked Rita of the long, lean, coffee-coloured
soldier, picturesque and ragged, who
was turning the strips with a forked stick.</p>

<p>"Pardon, gracious se&ntilde;orita, it does burn
up; not the first time, nor perhaps the second,
but without doubt the third."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then,&mdash;it is but to build another.
An affair of a moment, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>"But does not the meat often fall into the
fire when it breaks?"</p>

<p>"Sufficiently often, most noble. What of
that? It imparts a flavour of its own; one
brushes off the ashes&mdash;soldiers do not dine
at the Hotel Royal, one must observe. May
I offer the se&ntilde;orita a bit of this excellent
beef? This has not fallen down at all, or at
most but once, one little time."</p>

<p>Rita thanked him, but was not hungry.
At least she would have a cup of <i>guarapo</i>,
the hospitable cook begged; and he hastened
to bring her a cup of polished cocoanut shell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
filled with the favourite drink, which was
simply hot water with sugar dissolved in it.
Rita took the cup graciously, and drank to
the health of the camp, and to the freedom of
Cuba; the cook responded with many bows
and profuse thanks for the honour she had
done him, and the brother and sister passed
on.</p>

<p>"There are some good bananas near here,"
said Carlos; "little red ones, the kind you
like, Rita. I'll fill a basket for you to take
with you; Don Annunzio's may not be so
good."</p>

<p>They were making their way through a
tangle of tall grass and young palm-trees,
when suddenly Rita stopped, and laid her
hand on her brother's arm.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said. "Look yonder, Carlos!
The grass moves."</p>

<p>"A snake, perhaps," said Carlos; "or a
land-crab. Stand here a moment, and I will
go forward and see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>He advanced, looking keenly at the clump
of yellowish grass that Rita had pointed out.
Certainly, the grass did move. It quivered,
waved from side to side, then seemed to
settle down, as if an invisible hand were
pulling it from below. Carlos drew his
machete, and bent forward; whereupon a
loud yell was heard, and the clump of grass
shot up into the air, revealing a black face,
and a pair of rolling eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Rita, in terror. "Carlos,
come back to me! It is a devil!"</p>

<p>"Only a scout!" said her brother, laughing.
"One of our own men on outpost duty. Have
peace, Pablo! your hour is not yet come."</p>

<p>"<i>Caramba!</i> I thought it was, my captain!"
said the negro scout, grinning. "Better
be a crab than a Cuban in these days."</p>

<p>He was a singular figure indeed. From
head to waist he was literally clothed in grass,
bunches of it being tied over his head and
round his neck and shoulders, falling to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
thighs. A pair of ragged trousers of no
particular colour completed his costume. A
more perfect disguise could not be imagined;
indeed, except when he lifted his head, he
was not to be distinguished from the clumps
and tufts of dry grass all about him.</p>

<p>"Pablo is a good scout!" said Carlos, approvingly.
"No Gringo could possibly see you
till he stepped on you, Pablo; and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then!" said Pablo, grinning from
ear to ear; and he drew his machete and
went through an expressive pantomime which,
if carried out, would certainly have left very
little of Gringo or any one else.</p>

<p>"Is your post near here? show it! The
se&ntilde;orita would like to see how a Cuban scout
lives."</p>

<p>Pablo, a man of few words, gave a pleased
nod, and scuttled away through the bush,
beckoning them to follow. Rita, stepping
carefully along, holding her brother's hand,
kept her eyes on the scout for a few moments;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
then he seemed to melt into the rest of the
grass, and was gone. A few steps more, and
they almost fell over him, as his black face
popped up again, shaking back its grassy
fringes.</p>

<p>"Behold the domicile of Pablo!" he said,
with a magnificent gesture. "The property,
with all it contains, of the se&ntilde;orita and the
Se&ntilde;or Captain Don Carlos."</p>

<p>Brother and sister tried to look becomingly
impressed as they surveyed the domain.
Close under a waving palm-tree a rag of
brown canvas was stretched on two sticks
laid across upright branches stuck in the
ground. Under this awning was space for a
man to sit, or even to lie down, if he did not
mind his feet being in the sun. A small iron
pot, hung on three sticks over some blackened
stones, showed where the householder
did his cooking; a heap of leaves and grass
answered for bed and pillows; this was the
domicile of Pablo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Breaking a twig from a neighbouring
shrub, the scout bent over the pot, and
speared a plantain, which he offered to Rita
with grave courtesy. She took it with equal
dignity, thanking him with her most gracious
smile, and ate it daintily, praising its flavour
and the perfection of its cooking till the
good negro's face shone with pleasure.</p>

<p>"And you stay here alone, Pablo?" she
asked. "How long? you are not afraid?
No, of course not that; you are a soldier.
But lonely! is it not very lonely here, at
night above all?"</p>

<p>Pablo spread out his hands. "Se&ntilde;orita,
possibly&mdash;if it were not for the crabs.
These good souls&mdash;they have the disposition
of a Christian!&mdash;sit with me, in the intervals
of their occupations, and are excellent
company. They cannot talk, but that suits
me very well. Then, there is always the
chance of some one coming by&mdash;as to-day,
when the Blessed Virgin sends the se&ntilde;orita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and the Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos. Also at any
moment the devil may send me a Gringo;
their scouts are as plenty as scorpions. No,
se&ntilde;orita, I am not lonely. It is a fine life!
In a prison, you see, it would be quite otherwise."</p>

<p>"But there are other ways of living,
Pablo, beside scouting and going to prison,"
said Rita, much amused.</p>

<p>"Without doubt! Without doubt!" said
Pablo, cheerfully. "And assuredly neither
would befit the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'senorita'">se&ntilde;orita</ins>. May she live as
happy as she is beautiful, the sun being black
beside her. <i>Adios</i>, se&ntilde;orita; <i>adios</i>, Se&ntilde;or
Captain Don Carlos!"</p>

<p>"<i>Adios</i>, good Pablo! good luck to you
and your crabs!" and laughing and waving
a salute, they left the scout nodding his
grass-crowned head like a transformed mandarin,
and went back to the camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE PACIFICOS.</h3>


<p>A long, low adobe house, brilliantly white
with plaster; a verandah with swinging hammocks;
the inevitable green blinds; the inevitable
cane and banana patch; this was
Don Annunzio's. Don Annunzio Carreno
himself (to give him his full name for once,
though he seldom heard or used it) sat in a
large rocking-chair on the verandah, smoking.
He was enormously stout and supremely
placid, and he looked the picture of peace and
prosperity, in his spotless white suit and
broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>To Rita, weary after her ten miles' ride
from the camp, the whole place seemed a
page out of a picture-book. Her mind was
filled with rugged and startling images: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
rude hospital, with its ghastly sights and
homely though devoted tendance; the ragged
soldiers, with head or arm bound in bloody
bandages; the camp fire and kitchen, the
scout in his grassy panoply. Her eyes had
grown accustomed to sights like these, and
the bright whiteness of house and householder,
the trim array of flower-beds and
kitchen-garden, struck her as strange and artificial.
She felt as if Don Annunzio ought to
be wound up from behind, and was whimsically
surprised to see him rise and come
forward to meet them.</p>

<p>Carlos made his explanation, and presented
General Sevillo's letter. Don Annunzio's hat
was already in his hand and he was bowing
to Rita with all the grace his size allowed;
but now he implored them to enter the house,
which he declared he occupied henceforward
only at their pleasure.</p>

<p>"If the se&ntilde;orita will graciously descend!"
said the good man. "On the instant I call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
my wife. Prudencia! Where are you, then?
Visitors, Prudencia; visitors of distinction.
Hasten quickly!"</p>

<p>A woman appeared in the doorway; tall
and lean, clad in brown calico, with a sun-bonnet
to match, but with apron and kerchief
as snowy as Don Annunzio's "ducks."</p>

<p>"For the land's sake!" said Se&ntilde;ora Carreno.</p>

<p>Rita looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Visitors, my love!" Don Annunzio explained
rapidly, in good enough English.
"The Se&ntilde;or Captain and the Se&ntilde;orita Montfort,
bringing a note from his Excellency
General Sevillo. The se&ntilde;orita will remain
with us for some days; I have placed all at
her disposal; I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, Noonsey!" said the lady, not
unkindly. "You set down, and let me see
what's goin' on."</p>

<p>She laid a powerful hand on her husband's
shoulder, and pushed him into his chair again;
then advanced to the verandah steps, regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ing
the newcomers with frank but cheerful
scrutiny.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" she said. "Good
mornin'! Yes, it's a fine day. Won't you
step in?"</p>

<p>Carlos told his story, and asked permission
for his sister and her maid to spend some
days at the house until some permanent place
could be found for her.</p>

<p>The se&ntilde;ora considered with frowning brows,
not of anger but of consideration.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I did say I wouldn't
take no more boarders. I had trouble with
the last ones, and said I'd got through accommodatin'
folks. Still&mdash;I dunno but we could
manage&mdash;does she understand when she's
spoke to&mdash;English, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I do!" cried Rita, coming
forward. "I am only half Cuban; it is good
to hear you speak. If you will let me stay,
I will try to give little trouble. May I stay,
please?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I guess you may!" cried the New
England woman. "You walk right in and
lay off your things, and make yourself to
home. The idea! Why didn't you say&mdash;why,
it's as good as a meal o' victuals to hear you
speak. Been to the States, have you? Well,
now, if that don't beat all! Noonsey, you
go and tell Jos&eacute; we shall want them chickens
for supper. Set down, young man! This
your hired gal, dear? Does she speak English?
Well no, I s'pose not."</p>

<p>She said a few words to Manuela in Spanish
which, if not melodious, was intelligible, and
then led Rita into the house, talking all the
way.</p>

<p>"Here's the settin'-room; and here's the
spare-room off'n it. There! lay your things
on the bed, dear. I keep on talkin', when
all the time I want to hear you talk. It is
good to hear your native speech, say what
they will. Husband, he does his best, to
please me; but it's like as though he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
speakin' molasses, some way. Been in the
States to school, did you say?"</p>

<p>Rita told her story: of her American father,
who had always spoken English with her and
her brother; of the summer spent in the
North with her uncle and cousins. "Oh,"
she said, "you are right. I used to think
that I was two-thirds Cuban; I thought I
cared little, little, for the American part of
me. Now&mdash;but it is music to hear you
speak, Se&ntilde;ora Carreno."</p>

<p>"S'pose you call me Marm Prudence!"
said the good woman, half-shyly. "I don't
see as 'twould be any harm, and I should
like dretful well to hear the name again. I
was a widow when I married Don Noonzio.
Yes'm. My first husband was captain of a
fruit schooner. I voyaged with him considerable.
He died in Santiago, and I never
went back home: I couldn't seem to. I
washed and sewed for families I knew, and
then bumbye I married Don Noonzio. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gave me a good home, and he's a good provider.
There's times, though, that I'm terrible
homesick. There! I don't know what I
should do if 'twa'n't for my settin'-room.
Did you notice it, comin' through? I just
go there and set sometimes, and look round,
and cry. It does me a sight o' good."</p>

<p>Rita had indeed glanced around the sitting-room
as she passed through it, but it said
nothing to her. The six haircloth chairs,
the marble-topped centre-table with its wool
and bead mat, its glass lamp with the red
wick, its photograph-album and gilt family
Bible, did not speak her language. Neither
did the mantelpiece, with its two china
poodles and its bunches of dried grasses in
vases of red and white Bohemian glass. The
Cuban girl could not know how eloquent
were all these things to the exiled Vermont
woman; but she looked sympathetic, and felt
so, her heart warming to the homely soul,
with her rugged speech and awkward gestures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Marm Prudence now insisted that her guest
must be tired, and brought out a superb quilt,
powdered with red and blue stars, to tuck
her up under; but word came that Captain
Montfort was going, and Rita hurried out to
the verandah to bid him farewell. Carlos took
her in his arms, affectionately. "How is it,
then, little sister?" he asked. "Are you
reconciled at all? Can you stay here in peace
a little, with these good people?"</p>

<p>Rita returned his caress heartily. "You
were right, Carlos!" she said. "You and
the dear General were both right. It was
wonderful to be there in camp; I shall never
forget it; I hope I shall be better all my life
for it; but I could not have stayed long, I
see that now. Here I shall be taken care of;
here I shall rest, as under a grandmother's
care. This good Marm Prudence,&mdash;that is
what I am to call her, Carlos,&mdash;already I
love her, already she tends me as a bird tends
her young. Ah, Carlos, you will not neglect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Chico? I leave him as a sacred legacy. The
men implored me so. They said the bird had
brought them good fortune once, and would
be their salvation again; I had not the heart
to take him from them. You will see that
they do not feed him too much? Already
he has had a fit of illness from too much
kindness on the part of our faithful soldiers.
Thank you! and have no thought of me, my
brother; all will be well with me. Return
to your glorious duty, son of Cuba. It may
be that even here, in this peaceful spot, it
may be given to your Rita to serve the
mother we both adore. <i>Adios</i>, Carlos! Heaven
be with thee!"</p>

<p>Carlos, who was of a practical turn of mind,
was always uncomfortable when Rita spread
her rhetorical wings. He did not see why
she could not speak plain English. But he
kissed her affectionately, heartily glad that
he could leave her content with her surroundings;
and with a cordial farewell to the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
people of the house, he rode away, followed
by his clanking orderlies, leading the horse
Rita had ridden.</p>

<p>While all this had been going on, Manuela
had been arranging her mistress's things;
shaking out the crumpled dresses, brushing
off the bits of grass and broken straw that
clung to hem and ruffle, mementoes of the
days in camp. Manuela sighed over these
relics, and shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>"Poor Pepe!" she said. "If only he does
not fall into a fever from grief! Ah, love
is a terrible thing! <i>Dios!</i> what a rent in
the se&ntilde;orita's serge skirt! A paralysis on the
brambles in that place! yet it was a good
place. At least there was life. One heard
voices, neighing of horses, jingling of stirrups.
Here we shall grow into two young cabbages
beside that old one, my se&ntilde;orita and her poor
Manuela. Ah, life is very sad!"</p>

<p>Here Manuela chanced to look out of the
window, and saw a handsome Creole boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
leading a horse to water in the courtyard. Instantly
her face lighted up. She flew to the
looking-glass, and was arranging her hair
with passionate eagerness, when the door
opened, and Rita entered, followed by their
kind hostess. Manuela started, then turned
to drop a demure courtsey. "I was examining
the glass," she explained, "to see if it
was fit for the se&ntilde;orita to use. These common
mirrors, you understand, they draw the countenance
this way, that way,&mdash;" she expressed
her meaning in vivid pantomime,&mdash;"one
thinks one's visage of caoutchouc. But this
is passable; I assure you, se&ntilde;orita, passable."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" said Marm Prudence.
"My best looking-glass, that I brought from
Chelsea, Massachusetts, when I was first
married! If it ain't good enough for you,
young woman, you're free to do without it,
and so I tell you."</p>

<p>She spoke with some severity, but softened
instantly as she turned to Rita. "Now you'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lie down and rest you a spell, won't you, dear?"
she said. "I must go and see about supper,
and I sha'n't be satisfied till I see you tucked
up under my 'Old Glory spread.' That's what
I call it; it has the colours, you see. There!
comfortable? Now you shut your pretty eyes,
and have a good sleep. And you," she added,
turning to Manuela, "can come and help me
a spell, if you've nothing better to do. I'm
short-handed; help is turrible skurce in war-time,
and I can keep you out of Satan's hands,
if nothing else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>IN HIDING.</h3>


<p>"You busy, Miss Margaritty?"</p>

<p>It was Marm Prudence's voice, and at the
sound Rita opened her door quickly. She
and Manuela had been holding a mournful
consultation over the state of her wardrobe,
which had had rough usage during the past
two weeks, and she was glad of an interruption.</p>

<p>"I thought mebbe you'd like to come and
set with me a spell while I worked."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Rita, eagerly. "And
may I not work, too? Isn't there something
I can do to help?"</p>

<p>"Why, I should be pleased!" said the
good woman. "I'm braidin' hats for the
soldiers. I promised a dozen to-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
night. It's pretty work; mebbe you'd like
to try."</p>

<p>"For the soldiers? For our soldiers? Oh,
what joy, Marm Prudencia! No, Prudence,
you like better that. Show me, please! I
burn to begin."</p>

<p>"Why, you're real eager, ain't you?" said
Marm Prudence. "Now I'm glad I spoke;
I thought mebbe 'twould suit you. Young
folks like to be at something."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two were seated on
the cool inner verandah, looking out on the
garden, with a great basket between them,
heaped with delicate strips of palmetto leaf,
white and smooth.</p>

<p>"Husband, he whittles 'em for me," Marm
Prudence explained. "It's occupation for
him. Fleshy as he is, he can't get about
none too much, and this keeps his hands
busy. It's hard to be a man and lose the
activity of your limbs. But there! there's
compensations, I always say. If Noonsey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was as he was ten years ago, he'd be off with
the rest, and then where'd I be?"</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;Rita's eyes flashed, and she bent
nearer her hostess, and spoke low. "Then
you are not at heart <i>pacificos</i>, Marm Prudence.
On the surface, I understand, I comprehend,
it is necessary; but <i>au fond</i>, in your
secret hearts, you are with us; you are Cubans.
Is it not so? It must be so!"</p>

<p>"Oh, land, yes!" said Marm Prudence,
composedly. "I'm an American, you see;
and husband, he's a Cuban five generations
back. We don't have no dealin's with the
Gringos, more than we're obleeged to. Livin'
right close t' the road as we do, we can't let
out the way we feel, but I guess there's
mighty few Mambis about here but knows
where to come when they want things.
There ain't many so bold as your brother,
to come in open daylight, but come night,
they're often as thick as bats about the
garden here. There! I have to shoo' em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
off sometimes; yet I like to have 'em,
too."</p>

<p>Rita's face glowed with excitement. "Oh,
Marm Prudence," she cried; "how glorious!
Oh, what fortune, what joy, to be here with
you! We will work together; we will toil;
our blood shall flow in fountains, if it is
needed. Embrace me, mother of Cuba!"</p>

<p>Marm Prudence put on her spectacles, and
surveyed the excited girl with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Let me feel your pult, dear!" she said,
soothingly. "You got a touch o' sun, like as
not, riding in that heat this morning. Now
there's no call to get worked up, or talk
about blood-sheddin'. Blood-sheddin' ain't in
our line, yours nor mine, nor husband's
neither. Fur as doin' goes, we're all <i>pacificos</i>
here, Miss Margaritty, and you mustn't forget
that. Just wait a minute, and I'll go
and git you a cup of my balm-tea; 'tis real
steadyin' to the nerves, and I expect yours is
strung up some with all you've be'n through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Rita protested that she was perfectly well,
and not at all excited; but she submitted,
and drank the balm-tea meekly, as it was
cold and refreshing.</p>

<p>"It is my ardent nature!" she explained.
"It is the fire of my patriotism which
consumes me. Do you not feel it, Marm
Prudence, oftentimes, like a flame in your
bosom?"</p>

<p>No, Marm Prudence was not aware that
she did. Things took folks different, she
said, placidly. She had an aunt when she was
a little gal, that used to have spasms reg'lar
every time she heard the baker's cart. Some
thought she had had hopes of the baker before
he married a widow woman, but you
couldn't always account for these things.
What a pretty braid Rita was getting!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="600" height="399" alt="&quot;&#39;WAS SUCH A HAT EVER SEEN IN PARIS?&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;WAS SUCH A HAT EVER SEEN IN PARIS?&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;WAS SUCH A HAT EVER SEEN IN PARIS?&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Indeed, the work suited Rita's nimble fingers
to perfection, and yard after yard of
snowy braid rolled over her lap and grew
into a pile at her feet. She was eager to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
make her first hat. After an hour or two
of braiding, she discovered that it suited
Manuela's genius better than her own. The
basket of splints was turned over to the willing
handmaiden, and good-natured Marm
Prudence showed Rita how to sew the braids
together smooth and flat, and initiated her
into the mysteries of crown and brim. In
a creditably short space of time, Rita, with
infinite pride, held her first hat aloft, and
twirled it round and round on her finger.</p>

<p>"But, it is perfect!" she cried. "The
shape, the colour, the air of it. Manuela,
quick! a mirror! hold it for me&mdash;so! look!"
She took the ribbon from her belt, and began
to twist it in one coquettish knot after another
about the hat, which she had set on her dark
hair.</p>

<p>"Is that <i>chic?</i> Is it adorable, I ask you?
Was such a hat ever seen in Paris? Never!
I wear no other from this day on; hear me
swear it! It will become the rage; I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
make it so. Or&mdash;no! I will keep to myself the
secret, and others will die of envy. I name
it, Manuela. The Prudencia, for thee, my
kind hostess. Why do you laugh?"</p>

<p>Marm Prudence was twinkling in her quiet
way. "I was only thinkin' there'd have to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in the original">be</ins>
one soldier boy go without his hat to-morrow!"
she said, good-humouredly. "It does
look nice on you, though, Miss Margaritty,
that's certin."</p>

<p>Blushing scarlet, Rita tore the hat from
her head.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, casting it on the floor.
"Wretch, ingrate, <i>serpent</i> that I am! Take
away the glass, girl! take it away; break it
into a thousand pieces, to shame my vanity,
and never speak to me of hats again. Henceforward
I tie a shawl over my head, for the
remainder of my life; I have said it."</p>

<p>Much depressed, she worked away in silence,
as if her life depended upon it. Manuela,
shrugging her shoulders, carried off the glass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
but did not think it necessary to obey the
injunction to break it. She was used to her
se&ntilde;orita's outbreaks, and returned placidly
to her braiding as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The good hostess regarded her pretty
visitor with some alarm, mingled with amusement
and admiration. She might have her
hands full, she thought, if she attempted to
keep this young lady occupied, and out of
mischief. The time when she was asleep
was likely to be the most peaceful time in
Casa Annunzio. Yet how pretty she was!
and what a pleasure it was to hear her speak,
something between a bird and a flute. On
the whole, Marm Prudence thought her coming
a thing to be thankful for.</p>

<p>Talking with Don Annunzio himself that
evening, Rita found him far less guarded
than his wife in his expression of patriotic
zeal. He echoed her saying, that every
Mambi in the country knew where to come
when he wanted anything; and he went on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to draw lurid pictures of what he would do
to the Gringos if he but had the power.</p>

<p>"See, se&ntilde;orita!" he said, in his wheezy,
asthmatic voice. "I am powerless, am I
not? Already of a certain age, I am afflicted
with an accession of flesh; moreover, I am
short of breath, owing to this apoplexy of an
asthma. Worse than this, my legs, if the
se&ntilde;orita can pardon the allusion, refuse now
these two years to do their office. With two
sticks, I can hobble about the house and
garden; without them, behold me a fixture.
How, then? When the war breaks out, I
go to my General, to General Sevillo, under
whom I served in the ten years' war. I say
to him, 'Things are thus and thus with me,
but still I would serve my country. Give
me a horse, and let me ride with you as an
orderly.' Alas! it may not be. 'Annunzio,'
he says, 'your day of service in the field is
over. Stay at home, and help our men when
they call upon you. Thus you can do more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
good ten-fold than you could do in the
saddle.'</p>

<p>"<i>Ohim&eacute;!</i> my heart is broken; it is reduced
to powder, but what will you? reason, joined
to authority,&mdash;I am but a simple man, and
I obey. Since then, I sit and whittle splints
for my admirable wife. A woman, se&ntilde;orita,
to rule a nation! The Gringos pass by, and see
me working at my trade. I greet them civilly,
I supply requisitions when backed by authority;
again, what will you? I suffer in silence till
their back is turned, and my maledictions accompany
them along the road. Ah! if none of
them had longer life than I wish him, the
road would be encumbered with corpses.
Then,&mdash;draw your chair nearer, se&ntilde;orita, if
you will have the infinite graciousness,&mdash;then,
at night&mdash;it may be this very night&mdash;the
others come. Hush! yes&mdash;the Mambis; the
sons of Cuba. Quietly, by ones, by twos,
they appear, dropping from the sky, rising
from the earth. Then&mdash;ha! then, you shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
see. Not a word more, Se&ntilde;orita Margarita!
Donna Prudencia is a pearl, an empress
among women, but rightly named; she complains
that I talk too much on these subjects.
But when one's heart is in the field, and one's
legs refuse to follow,&mdash;again, what would
you? No matter! silence is golden! Wait
but a little, and you shall see. Who knows?
It may be this very night."</p>

<p>Thus Don Annunzio, with many nods and
winks, and gestures of dramatic caution. His
words fanned the flame of Rita's zeal, and
she longed for one of the promised nocturnal
visits. That night and the next she was
constantly waking, listening for a whisper,
the clank of a chain, the jingle of a spur;
but none came, and the nights passed as
peacefully as the days. The dozen, and more,
were completed; and then, in spite of her
vow, Rita found time to make one for herself,
certainly as pretty a hat as heart could
desire. So pretty, Rita thought it a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
pities that there was no one beside Don
Annunzio and Marm Prudence to see her
in it. She sighed, and thought of the camp
among the hills, of Carlos and the General,
and Don Uberto.</p>

<p>One day, soon after noon, Marm Prudence
asked Rita if she would like to take a walk
with her. Rita assented eagerly, and put
on her pretty hat. She looked on with surprise
as Marm Prudence proceeded to take
from a cupboard an ample covered basket,
from which protruded the neck of a bottle
and some plump red bananas.</p>

<p>"Are we going on a picnic, then?" she
asked.</p>

<p>The good woman nodded. "You'll see,
time enough!" she said. "It's a picnic
for somebody, if not for us, Miss Margaritty.
Look, dear! is Don Noonsey out in the ro'd
there?"</p>

<p>Don Annunzio was out in the road, having
made what was quite a journey for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
him, down the verandah steps, along the
garden walk, and across the sunny road.
He now stood shading his eyes with his
hand, looking this way and that with anxious
glances.</p>

<p>At length, "All is quiet!" he said. "The
road is clear, and no sign anywhere. Make
haste then, <i>mi alma</i>, and cross while yet all
is safe."</p>

<p>Beckoning to Rita, Marm Prudence slipped
out and across the road swiftly, not pausing
till she had gained the screen of a thick
clump of cacti. Rita kept close to her side,
drinking the mystery like wine. They stood
for a few moments behind the aloes; then
Don Annunzio spoke again.</p>

<p>"All is still perfect, and you may go without
fear. Carry my best greetings whither
you are going. At the proper hour I will
await you here, and signal when return is
safe."</p>

<p>Without wasting words, his wife waved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
her hand, and turning, plunged into the
forest, followed by the delighted Rita.</p>

<p>The tangle of underbrush was higher than
their heads, but they made their way quickly,
and Rita soon saw that a narrow path wound
along through the bush, and that the ground
under her feet had been trodden many times.
The trees towered high above the dense undergrowth,
some leafy and branching, others, the
palms, tossing their single plume aloft. Open
near the wood, the wood grew thicker and
thicker, till it stood like a wall on either side
of the narrow footpath; the twigs and leaves,
broken and crushed here and there, showed,
like the path, the traces of frequent passage.</p>

<p>Rita was burning with curiosity, yet she
would not for worlds have asked a question.
They were nearing every moment the heart
of the mystery; she would not spoil the
dramatic effect by prying into it too soon.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a gleam of sunlight struck
through the trees. They were near the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the wood, then. A few steps more, and
she caught her breath, with a low cry of
amazement.</p>

<p>A round hollow, dipping deep like a cup,
with here and there a great tree standing.
On one side, a clear spring flowing from a
rocky cleft. Under one tree, a hammock
slung, and in a hammock a man asleep.
Thus much Rita saw at the first glance. The
next instant the man was on his feet, and
the long barrel of his carbine gleamed level
at sight.</p>

<p>"<i>Alto! quien va?</i>" the challenge rang
clear and sharp.</p>

<p>"<i>Cuba!</i>" replied Se&ntilde;ora Carreno. "For
the land's sake, Mr. Delmonty, don't start
a person like that. You'd oughter know my
sunbunnit by this time."</p>

<p>The young man had already lowered his
weapon, and showed a laughing face of
apology as he lifted his broad-brimmed
hat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Donna Prudencia,"
he said. "I was asleep, and dreaming; not
of angels!" he added, as he made another
low bow, which included Rita in its sweep
of respectful courtesy.</p>

<p>He spoke English like an Anglo-Saxon,
without trace of accent or hesitation. His
hair and complexion were brown, but a pair
of bright blue eyes lightened his face in an
extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>Who might this be?</p>

<p>"Mr. Delmonty, let me make ye acquainted
with Miss Margaritty Montfort!" said Se&ntilde;ora
Carreno, with some ceremony. "Miss Montfort
is stoppin' with us for a spell. Both of
you bein' half Yankee, I judged you might
be pleased to meet up with each other."</p>

<p>Rita bowed with her most queenly air;
then relaxed, as she met the merry glance
of the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you?" she said. "I am very glad&mdash;but
your name is Spanish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father was a Cuban," said the young
man; "my mother is American. She was
a Russell of Claxton." He paused a moment,
as if inviting comment; but Rita, brought up
in Cuba, knew nothing of the Russells of
Claxton, a famous family.</p>

<p>"I've been in the North most of the time
since I was a little shaver," he went on, "at
school and college; came down here last year,
when things seemed to be brewing. Have you
been much in Boston, Miss Montfort? We
might have some acquaintances in common."</p>

<p>Rita shook her head, and told him of her
one summer in the North. "I hope to go
again," she said, "when our country is free.
When Cuba has no longer need of her
daughters, as well as her sons, I shall gladly
return to that fair northern country."</p>

<p>Again she caught a quizzical glance of the
blue eyes, and was reminded, she hardly
knew why, of her Uncle John. But Uncle
John's eyes were brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are&mdash;alone here, Se&ntilde;or Delmonte?"
she asked, glancing around the solitary dell.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young man, composedly.
"I'm in hiding."</p>

<p>Rita's eyes flashed. Hiding! a son of
Cuba! skulking about in the woods, while
his brother soldiers were at the front, or,
like Carlos, guarding the hill passes! This
was indeed being only half a Cuban. She
would have nothing to do with recreant
soldiers; and she turned away with a face
of cold displeasure.</p>

<p>"How's your foot?" asked Se&ntilde;ora Carreno,
abruptly. "That last dressing fetch it, do
you think?"</p>

<p>"All right!" said the young man.
"Look! I have my shoe on." And he
held up one foot with an air of triumph.
"I shall be ready for the road to-night, and
take my troublesome self off your hands,
Se&ntilde;ora Carreno."</p>

<p>"No trouble at all!" said the good woman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
earnestly. "Not a mite of trouble but what
was pleasure, Captain Jack."</p>

<p>Captain Jack! where had Rita heard that
name? Before she could try to think, her
hostess went on.</p>

<p>"Well, I kinder hate to have you go, but
of course you're eager, same as all young
folks are. But look here! You'd better
pass the night with us, and let me see to
your foot once more, and give you a good
night's sleep in a Christian bed; and then
I can mend up your things a bit, and you
lay by till night again, and start off easy
and comfortable."</p>

<p>"It sounds very delightful," said the young
man, with a glance at the charming girl who
would stand with her head turned away.
"But how about the Gringos, Donna Prudencia?
Supposing some of them should
come along to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"They won't come to-morrow!" said Marm
Prudence, significantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"No? you have assurance of that? and
why may they not come to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Because they've come to-day, most likely!"</p>

<p>Rita started, and turned back toward the
speakers.</p>

<p>"The Gringos? to-day?" she cried.</p>

<p>Marm Prudence nodded. "That was why
I brought you here, dear," she said; "most
of the reason, that is. We got word they
was most likely comin', quite a passel of 'em;
and we judged it was well, Don Noonsey and
me, that they shouldn't see you. I thought
mebbe," she added, with a sly glance at the
basket, "that if I brought a little something
extry, we might get an invitation to take
a bite of luncheon, but we don't seem to."</p>

<p>"Oh! but who could have supposed that
I was to have <i>all</i> the good things in the
world?" cried Delmonte, merrily. "This is
really too good to be true. Help me, Donna
Prudencia, while I set out the feast! Why,
this is the great day of the whole campaign."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The two unpacked the basket, with many
jests and much laughter; they were evidently
old friends. Meantime Rita stood by, uncertain
of her own mood. To miss an experience,
possibly terrible, certainly thrilling; to have
lost an opportunity of declaring herself a
daughter of Cuba, possibly of shooting a
Spaniard for herself, and to have been deceived,
tricked like a child; this brought her
slender brows together, ominously, and made
her eyes glitter in a way that Manuela would
have known well. On the other hand&mdash;here
was a romantic spot, a young soldier,
apparently craven, but certainly wounded,
and very good-looking; and here was luncheon,
and she was desperately hungry. On the
whole&mdash;</p>

<p>The tragedy queen disappeared, and it was
a cheerful though very dignified young person
who responded gracefully to Delmonte's petition
that she would do him the favour to
be seated at his humble board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>MANUELA'S OPPORTUNITY.</h3>


<p>That was a pleasant little meal, under
the great plane-tree in the cup-shaped dell.
Marm Prudence had kept, through all her
years of foreign residence, her New England
touch in cookery, and Se&ntilde;or Delmonte declared
that it was worth a whole campaign
twice over to taste her doughnuts. They
drank "<i>Cuba Libre</i>" in raspberry vinegar
that had come all the way from Vermont,
and Rita was obliged to confess that Se&ntilde;or
Delmonte was a charming host, and that she
was enjoying herself extremely.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when she and
Marm Prudence took their way back through
the forest. At first Rita was silent; but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
distance increased between them and the dell,
she could not restrain her curiosity.</p>

<p>How was it, she asked, that this young
man was there alone, separated from his
companions? He said he was in hiding. Hiding!
a detestable, an unworthy word! Why
should a son of Cuba be in hiding, she wished
to know! She had worked herself into a
fine glow of indignation again, and was ready
to believe anything and everything bad about
the agreeable youth with the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I must know!" she repeated, dropping
her voice to a contralto note that she was
fond of. "Tell me, Marm Prudence; tell me
all! have I broken the bread of a recreant?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was my bread," said Marm
Prudence, dryly. "I'll tell you, if you'll give
me a chance, Miss Margaritty. I supposed,
though, that you'd have heard of Jack Delmonty;
Captain Jack, as they call him. Since
his last raid the Gringos have offered a big reward
for him, alive or dead. He was wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in the foot, and thought he might hender his
troop some if he tried to go with them in
that state. So he camped here, and we've
seen to him as best we could."</p>

<p>Rita was dumb, half with amazement, half
with mortification. How was it possible that
she had been so stupid? Heard of Captain
Jack? where were her wits? the daring guerrilla
leader, the pride of the Cuban bands, the
terror of all Spaniards in that part of the
island. Why, he was one of her pet heroes;
only&mdash;only she had fancied him so utterly different.
The Captain Jack of her fancy was a
gigantic person, with blue-black curls, with
eyes like wells of black light (she had been
fond of this bit of description, and often repeated
it to herself), a superb moustache, and
a nose absolutely Grecian, like the Santillo
nose of tender memory. This half-Yankee
stripling, blue-eyed, with a nose that&mdash;yes,
that actually turned up a little, and the
merest feather of brown laid on his upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lip&mdash;how could she or any one suppose this
to be the famous cavalry leader?</p>

<p>Rita blushed scarlet with distress, as she
remembered her bearing, which she had tried
to make as scornful as was compatible with
good manners. She had meant, had done her
best, to show him that she thought lightly of
a Cuban soldier who, for what reason soever,
proclaimed himself without apology to be "in
hiding." To be sure, he had not seemed to
feel the rebuke as she had expected he would.
Once or twice she had caught that look of
Uncle John in his eyes; the laughing, critical,
yet kindly scrutiny that always made her
feel like a little girl, and a silly girl at that.
Was that what she had seemed to Captain
Delmonte? Of course it was. She had had
the great, the crowning opportunity of her
life, of doing homage to a real hero (she
forgot good General Sevillo, who had been a
hero in a quiet and business-like way for
sixty years), and she had lost the opportunity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very subdued Rita who returned
to the house that evening. At the
edge of the wood they were met by Don
Annunzio, who stood as before, smoking his
long black cigar, and scrutinising the road
and the surrounding country. A wave of
his hand told them that all was well, and
they stepped quickly across the road, and in
another minute were on the verandah.</p>

<p>Don Annunzio followed them with an elaborate
air of indifference; but once seated in
his great chair, he began to speak eagerly,
gesticulating with his cigar.</p>

<p>"<i>Dios!</i> Prudencia, you had an inspiration
from heaven this day. What I have been
through! the sole comfort is that I have lost
twenty pounds at least, from sheer anxiety.
Imagine that you had not been gone an hour,
when up they ride, the <i>guerrilla</i> that was reported
to us yesterday. At their head, that
pestiferous Col. Diego Moreno. He dismounts,
demands coffee, bananas, what there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is. I go to get them; and, the saints aiding
me, I meet in the face the pretty Manuela.
Another instant, and she would have been on
the verandah, would have been seen by these
swine, female curiosity having led her to
imagine a necessary errand in that direction.
I seize this charming child by the
shoulders, I push her into her room. I tell
her, 'Thou hast a dangerous fever. Go to
thy bed on the instant, it is a matter of
thy life.'</p>

<p>"My countenance is such that she obeys
without a word. She is an admirable
creature! Beauty, in the female sex&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do go on, Noonsey," said his wife, good-naturedly,
"and never mind about beauty
now. Land knows we have got other things
to think about."</p>

<p>"It is true, it is true, my own!" replied
the amiable fat man. "I return to the
verandah. This man is striding up and
down, cutting at my poor vines with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
apoplexy of a whip. He calls me; I stand
before him thus, civil but erect.</p>

<p>"'Have you any strangers here, Don
Annunzio?'</p>

<p>"'No, Se&ntilde;or Colonel.'</p>

<p>"It is true, se&ntilde;orita. To make a stranger
of you, so friendly, so gracious&mdash;the thought
is intolerable.</p>

<p>"He approaches, he regards me fixedly.</p>

<p>"'A young lady, Se&ntilde;orita Montfort, and
her maid, escaped from the carriage of her
stepmother, the honourable Se&ntilde;ora Montfort,
while on the way to the convent of the White
Sisters, ten days ago. A man of my command
was taken by these hill-cats of Mambis,
and carried to a camp in this neighbourhood.
He escaped, and reported to me that a young
lady and her attendant were in the camp.
I raided the place yesterday.'</p>

<p>"'With success, who can doubt?' I said.
Civility may be used even to the devil, whom
this officer strongly resembled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"He stamped his feet, he ground his teeth,
fire flashed from his eyes. 'They were
gone!' he said. 'They had been gone
but a few hours, for the fires were still burning,
but no trace of them was to be found.
I found, however, in a deserted <i>rancho</i>,&mdash;this!'
and he held up a delicate comb of
tortoise-shell."</p>

<p>"My side-comb!" cried Rita. "I wondered
where I had lost it. Go on, pray, Don
Annunzio."</p>

<p>"He questioned me again, this colonel, on
whom may the saints send a lingering disease.
I can swear that there is no young lady in
the house? but assuredly, I can, and do swear
it, with all earnestness. He whistles, and
swears also&mdash;in a different manner. He
says, 'I must search the house. This is an
important matter. A large reward is offered
by the Se&ntilde;ora Montfort for the discovery of
this young lady.'</p>

<p>"'Search every rat-hole, my colonel,' I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
reply; 'but first take your coffee, which is
ready at this moment.'</p>

<p>"In effect, Antonia arrives at the instant
with the tray. While she is serving him, I
find time to slip with the agility of the serpent
into the passage, and turn the handle
of the bedroom door. 'Spotted fever!' I
cry through the crack; and am back at my
post before the colonel could see round Antonia's
broad back. Good! he drinks his
coffee. He devours your cakes, my Prudencia,
keeping his eye on me all the time, and
plying me with questions. I tell him all is
well with us, except the sickness.</p>

<p>"'How then? what sickness?'</p>

<p>"'A servant is ill with fever,' I say. 'We
hope that it will not spread through the
house; it is a bad time for fever.' I see he
does not like that, he frowns, he mutters
maledictions. I profess myself ready to conduct
him through my poor premises; I lead
him through the parlour, which he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
sense to admire, to the kitchen, to our own
apartment, my cherished one. All the time
my heart flutters like a wounded dove. I
cry in my soul, 'All depends on the wit of
that child. If she had but gone with Prudencia
to the forest!'</p>

<p>"Finally there is no escape, we must pass
the door. I stop before it. 'Open!' says
the colonel.</p>

<p>"'Your Excellency will observe,' I say,
'that there is a dangerous case of spotted
fever in this room.'</p>

<p>"He turns white, then black. He pulls
his moustache, which resembles a mattress.</p>

<p>"At last 'How do I know?' he cries;
'You may be lying! all Cubans are liars.
The girl may be in this room!'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="279" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;I THROW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEP BACK, MY HEART IN MY MOUTH.&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;I THROW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEP BACK, MY HEART IN MY MOUTH.&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;I THROW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEP BACK, MY HEART IN MY MOUTH.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I throw open the door and step back, my
heart in my mouth, my eyes flinging themselves
into the apartment. Heavens! what do
we see? a hideous face projects itself from the
bed. Red&mdash;black&mdash;a face from the pit! A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
horrible smell is in our nostrils&mdash;we hear
groans&mdash;enough! The colonel staggers back,
cursing. I close the door and follow him out
to the verandah. My own nerves are shaken,
I admit it; it was a thing to shatter the
soul. Still cursing, he mounts his horse, and
rides away with his troop. I see them go.
They carry away the best of what the house
holds, but what of that? they are gone!</p>

<p>"I hasten, as well as my infirmity allows,
to the chamber. I cry 'Manuela, is it thou?'</p>

<p>"I am bidden to enter. I open the door,
and find that admirable child at the toilet-table,
washing her face and laughing till
the tears flow. Already half of her pretty
face is clean, but half still hideous to
behold.</p>

<p>"'How did you do it?' I ask her. She
laughs more merrily than before; if you have
noticed, she has a laughter of silver bells,
this maiden. 'The red lip-salve,' she says,
'and a little ink. Have no fear, Don An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>nunzio;
it was you who discovered the fever,
you know.'</p>

<p>"'But the smell, my child? there must be
something bad here, something unhealthy; a
vile smell!'</p>

<p>"She laughs again, this child. 'I burned
a piece of tortoise-shell,' she says. 'Saint
Ursula forgive me, it was one of the se&ntilde;orita's
side-combs, but there was nothing else
at hand.'</p>

<p>"Thus then, se&ntilde;orita, thus, my Prudencia,
has Manuela virtually saved our house and
ourselves. Hasten to embrace her! I have
already permitted myself the salute of a
father upon her charming cheek, as simple
gratitude enjoined it."</p>

<p>As if by magic&mdash;could she have been
listening in the passage?&mdash;Manuela appeared,
blushing and radiant. Donna Prudencia
did not think it necessary to kiss
her, but she shook her warmly by the hand,
telling her that she was a good girl, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
fit to be a Yankee, a compliment which
Manuela hardly appreciated. As for Rita,
she kissed the girl on both cheeks, and stood
holding her hands, gazing at her with wistful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, Manuela," she cried; "I must not
begrudge it to you. You are a heroine; you
have had the opportunity, and you knew
how to take it. Daughter of Cuba, your
sister blesses you."</p>

<p>Before Manuela could reply, Donna Prudencia
broke in. "There! there!" she said.
"Come down off your high horse, Miss
Margaritty, there's a dear; and help me to
see to things. Here's Captain Delmonty
coming to-night, and them chicken-thieves
of Gringos have carried off every living
thing there was to eat in the house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN JACK.</h3>


<p>When Jack Delmonte appeared, late in
the evening, he was puzzled at the change
which had come over the pretty Grand Duchess,
as he had mentally nicknamed Rita. In
the afternoon she had appeared, he could
not imagine why, to regard him as a portion
of the scum of the earth. He thought her
extremely pretty, and full of charm, yet he
could not help feeling provoked, in spite of
his amusement, at the disdainful curl at the
corners of her mouth when she addressed
him. Now, he was equally at a loss to
understand why or how the Grand Duchess
was replaced by a gentle and tender-voiced
maiden, who looked up at him from under
her long curved lashes with timid and dep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>recatory
glances. She insisted on mixing
his <i>granita</i> herself, and brought it in the
one valuable cup Marm Prudence possessed,
a beautiful old bit of Lowestoft. She begged
to hear from his own lips about his last raid&mdash;about
all his raids. She had heard about
some of them; the one where he had swum
the river under fire to rescue the little lame
boy; the other, when he had chased five
Spaniards for half a mile, with no other
weapon than a banana pointed at full cock.
She even knew of some exploits that he
had never heard of; and the honest captain
found himself blushing under his tan, and
finally changed the subject by main force.
It was very pleasant, of course, to have this
lovely creature hanging on his words, and
supplementing them with others of her own,
only too extravagantly laudatory; but a fellow
must tell the truth; and&mdash;and after all,
what was the meaning of it? She wouldn't
look at him, three hours ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Had they had a gay winter in Havana?
he asked. He hadn't been to a dance for
forty years. Was she fond of dancing? of
course she was. What a pity they couldn't&mdash;here
he happened to glance at Rita's black
dress, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Miss Montfort, I beg your pardon! It
was very stupid of me. I ran on without
thinking. You are in mourning. What a
brute I am!"</p>

<p>The tears had gathered in Rita's eyes, but
now she smiled through them. "It is six
months since my father died," she said.
"He was the kindest of fathers, though,
alas! Spanish in his sympathies."</p>

<p>"Your mother?" hazarded Jack, full of
sympathy.</p>

<p>"My mother died three years ago. My
stepmother&mdash;" then followed the tale of
her persecution, her escape, and subsequent
adventures. Captain Jack was delighted
with the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he exclaimed. "That was
tremendously plucky, you know, going off
in that way. That was fine! and you got
to your brother all right? I wonder&mdash;is he&mdash;are
you any relation of Carlos Montfort?
Not his sister? You don't mean it. Why,
I was at school with Carlos, the first school
I ever went to. An old priest kept it, in
Plaza Nero. Carlos was a good fellow, and
gave me the biggest licking once&mdash;I'm
very glad we met, Miss Montfort. And&mdash;I
don't mean to be impertinent, I'm sure you
know that; but&mdash;what are you going to do
now?"</p>

<p>Alas! Rita did not know. "I thought I
was safe here," she said. "I was to stay
here with these good people till word came
from my uncle in the States, or till there
was a good escort that might take me to
some port whence I could sail to New York.
Now&mdash;I do not know; I begin to tremble,
Se&ntilde;or Delmonte. To-day, while Donna Pru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>dencia
and I were in the forest, a Spanish
<i>guerrilla</i> came here, looking for me. Don
Diego Moreno was in command. He is a
friend of my stepmother's. I know him,
a cold, hateful man. If he had found me&mdash;"
she shuddered.</p>

<p>"I know Diego Moreno, too," said Delmonte;
and his brow darkened. "He is
not fit to look at you, much less to speak
to you. Never mind, Miss Montfort! don't
be afraid; we'll manage somehow. If no
better way turns up, I'll take you to Puerto
Blanco myself. Trouble is, these fellows are
rather down on me just now; but we'll
manage somehow, never fear! Hark! what's
that?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, listening intently. A
faint sound was heard, hardly more than a
breathing. Some night-bird, was it? It
came from the fringe of forest across the
road. Again it sounded, two notes, a long
and a short one, soft and plaintive. A bird,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
certainly, thought Rita. She started as Captain
Delmonte imitated the call, repeating
it twice.</p>

<p>"Juan," he said, briefly. "Reporting for
orders. Here he comes!"</p>

<p>A burly figure crossed the road in three
strides. Three more brought him to the
verandah, where he saluted and stood at
attention.</p>

<p>"Well, Juan, where are the rest of you?"</p>

<p>"In the usual place, Se&ntilde;or Captain, four
miles from here," said the orderly. "I have
brought Aquila; he is here in the thicket,
my own horse also. Will you ride to-night?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at daybreak, Juan. I have
promised Se&ntilde;ora Carreno to sleep one night
under her roof, and convince her that my foot
is entirely well. Bring Aquila into the courtyard.
All is quiet in the neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"All quiet, Se&ntilde;or Captain. Good; I bring
Aquila and return to the troop. You will be
with us, then, before sunrise?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before sunrise without fail," said Captain
Jack. "<i>Buenos noches, Juanito!</i>"</p>

<p>The trooper saluted again, and slipped back
across the road; next moment he reappeared
leading a long, lean, brown horse, who walked
as if he were treading on eggshells. They
passed into the courtyard and were seen no
more, Juan making his way back to the
thicket by some unseen path.</p>

<p>"You do not stay with us through the day
then, Mr. Delmonte? I am sorry!" said Rita.</p>

<p>"I wish I could, indeed I do; but I must
get to my fellows as soon as possible. I shall
come back, though, in a day or two, and put
myself and my troop at your orders, Miss
Montfort. How would you like to lead a
troop, like Madame Hernandez?" He laughed,
but Rita's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"But I would die to do it!" she cried.
"Ah! Se&ntilde;or Delmonte, once to fight for my
country, and then to die&mdash;that is my ambition."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you'd do it well, I am sure!" said
Delmonte, warmly; "the fighting part, I
mean. But nobody would let you die, Miss
Montfort, it would spoil the prospect."</p>

<p>He spoke lightly, for heroics embarrassed
him, as they did Carlos.</p>

<p>Soon after, Donna Prudencia appeared, with
bedroom candles, and stood looking benevolently
at the two young people.</p>

<p>"I expect you've been having a good visit,"
she said. "Well, there's an end to all, and
it's past ten o'clock, Miss Margaritty."</p>

<p>Rita rose with some reluctance; nor did
Captain Delmonte seem enthusiastic on the
subject of going to bed.</p>

<p>"Such a beautiful night!" he said. "Must
you go, Miss Montfort? I mustn't keep you
up, of course. Good-bye, then, for a few days!
I shall be gone before daybreak. I'm very
glad we have met."</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily. Rita somehow
did not find words so readily as usual. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
too am glad," she said. "It is something&mdash;I
have always wished to meet the 'Star of
Horsemen!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> don't!" cried Jack, in distress.
"That was just a joke of those idiots of mine.
Good gracious! if you go to calling names,
Miss Montfort, I shall not dare to come back
again. Good night!"</p>

<p>It was long before Rita could sleep. She
lay with wide-open eyes, conjuring up one
scene after another, in all of which Captain
Delmonte played the hero's part, and she the
heroine's. He was rescuing her single-handed
from a regiment of Spaniards; they were galloping
together at the head of a troop, driving
the Gringos like sheep before them. Or, he
was wounded on the field of battle, and she was
kneeling beside him, holding water to his lips,
and blessing the good Cuban surgeon who had
taught her bandaging in the camp among the
hills. At length, hero and heroine, Cuban and
Spaniard, faded away, and she slept peacefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it? what is the matter?" Rita
sprang up in her bed and listened. The sound
that had awakened her was repeated: a knock
at the door; a voice, low but imperative; the
voice of Jack Delmonte.</p>

<p>"Miss Montfort! are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what has happened?"</p>

<p>"The Gringos! Dress yourself quickly,
and come out. You can dress in the dark?"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, yes! I will come. Manuela!
wake! wake! don't speak, but dress yourself;
the Spaniards are here."</p>

<p>Hastily, with trembling hands, the two girls
put on their clothes. No thought now of
how or what; anything to cover them, and
that quickly. They hurried out into the
passage; Delmonte stood there, carbine in
hand. He spoke almost in a whisper, yet
every word fell clearly on their strained
ears.</p>

<p>"It's not Moreno; it's Velaya's <i>guerrilla:</i>
we must get away before they fire the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Give me your hand, Miss Montfort; you will
be quiet, I know. Your maid?"</p>

<p>"Manuela, you will not speak!"</p>

<p>"No, se&ntilde;orita!" said poor Manuela, with a
stifled sob.</p>

<p>"My horse is ready saddled," Delmonte
went on. "If I can get you away before they
see us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me! but what will become of the others?"
cried Rita, under her breath. "I cannot
desert Manuela and Marm Prudence&mdash;Donna
Prudencia."</p>

<p>"I am going to save you," said Jack Delmonte,
quietly. "If for no other reason, I
have just given my word to Donna Prudencia.
The rest&mdash;I'll get back as soon as I
can, that's all I can say. Follow me! hark!"</p>

<p>A shot rang out; another, and another.
A hubbub of voices rose within and without
the house; and at the same instant a bright
light sprang up, and they saw each other's
faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Delmonte ground his teeth. "Wait!"
he said; and going a little way along the
passage, he peered from a window. The
verandah swarmed with armed men. The
door was locked and barred, but they were
smashing the window-shutters with the butts
of their carbines. He glanced along the
passage. Inside the door stood Don Annunzio,
in his vast white pajamas, firing composedly
through a wicket; beside him his
wife, as quietly loading and handing him
the weapons. Behind them huddled the
few house and farm servants, negroes for
the most part, but among them was one
intelligent-looking young Creole. Singling
him out, Delmonte led him apart, and
pointed to Manuela. "Your sister!" he
said. "Your life for hers."</p>

<p>The youth nodded, and beckoned the
frightened girl to stand beside him. Rita
saw no more, for Delmonte, grasping her
hand firmly, led her through the winding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
passage and into the inner courtyard. Pausing
a moment on the verandah, they looked
through the archway at one side, through
which streamed a red glare. The cane
patch was on fire, and blazing fiercely.
The flames tossed and leaped, and in
front of them men were running with
torches, setting fire to sheds and out-houses.
Their shouts, the crackling and
hissing of the flames, the shots and cries
from the front of the house, turned the
quiet night wild with horror. A crash
behind them told that the front door had
yielded.</p>

<p>"It's run for it, now!" said Delmonte,
quietly. "Now, then, child,&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>A few steps, and they were beside the
brown horse, standing saddled and bridled,
and already quivering and straining to be
off. Delmonte lifted Rita in his arms,&mdash;no
time now for courtly mounting,&mdash;then
sprang to the saddle before her. He spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to the horse, who stood trembling, but made
no motion to advance.</p>

<p>"Aquila, softly past the gate&mdash;then for
life! good boy! Miss Montfort, put your
arms around me, and hold fast. Don't let
go unless I drop; then try to catch the
reins, and give him his head. He knows
the way."</p>

<p>Softly, slowly, Aquila crept to the archway.
He might have been shod with velvet
for any sound he made. Could they get
away unseen? The men with the torches
were busy at their horrid work; they could
not be seen yet from the front of the house.
The horse crept forward, silent as a phantom.
They were clear of the archway.
"Now!" whispered Delmonte. "For life,
Aquila!" and Aquila went, for life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>FOR LIFE.</h3>


<p>"If we can put the fire between us and
them," said Captain Jack, "we shall get
off."</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if they might
do it. Already they saw the road before
them, the sand glowing red in the firelight.
A few more strides&mdash;Just then, a Spanish
soldier came running round the corner of
the burning cane-patch, whirling his blazing
torch. He saw them, and raised a shout.
"<i>Alerta! alerta!</i> fugitives! after them!
shoot down the Mambi dogs!"</p>

<p>There was a rush to the corner where
a score of horses stood tethered to the
fence. A dozen men leaped into the saddle
and came thundering in pursuit. Aquila<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
gave one glance back; then stretched his
long lean neck, and settled into a gallop.</p>

<p>Before them the road lay straight for
some distance, red here in the crimson light,
further on white under a late moon. On
one side the woods rose black and still, on
the other lay open fields crossed here and
there by barbed wire fences. No living
creature was to be seen on the road. No
sound was heard save the muffled beat
of the horse's hoofs on the sand, and behind,
the shouts and cries of their pursuers.
Were they growing louder, those shouts?
Were they gaining, or was the distance between
them widening? Rita turned her
head once to look back. "I wouldn't do
that!" said Delmonte, quietly. "Do you
mind, Miss Montfort, if I swing you round
in front of me? Don't be alarmed, Aquila is
all right."</p>

<p>Before Rita could speak, he had dropped
the reins on the horse's neck, and lifted her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
bodily round to the peak of the saddle before
him. "I'm sorry!" he said, apologetically.
"I fear it is very uncomfortable; but&mdash;I
can&mdash;a&mdash;manage better, don't you see?"
But to himself he was saying, "Lucky I got
that done before the beggars began to shoot.
Now they may fire all they like. Stupid
duffer I was, not to start right."</p>

<p>He had felt the girl's light figure quiver
as he lifted her.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Miss Montfort," he
said again. "There isn't a horse in the
country that can touch Aquila when he is
roused."</p>

<p>"I am not frightened," said Rita. "I am&mdash;excited,
I suppose. It is like riding on
wind, isn't it?"</p>

<p>It was true that she felt no fear; neither
did she realise the peril of their position. It
was one of the dreams come true, that was
all. She was riding with Delmonte, with the
Star of Horsemen. He was saving her life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
They had ridden so before, often and often;
only now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pah!</i> a short, sharp report was heard,
and a little dust whiffed up on the road
beside them. <i>Pah! pah!</i> another puff of
dust, and splinters flew from a tree just beyond
them. Aquila twitched his ears and
stretched his long neck, and they felt the
stride quicken under them. The road rushed
by; they were half-way to the turn.</p>

<p>"Would you like to hold the reins for a
bit?" asked Delmonte. "It isn't really
necessary, but&mdash;thanks! that's very nice."</p>

<p>What was he doing? He had turned half
round in the saddle; something touched her
hair&mdash;the butt of his carbine. "I <i>beg</i> your
pardon!" said Captain Jack. "I am very
clumsy, I fear."</p>

<p><i>Crack!</i> went the carbine. Rita's ears rang
with the noise; she held the reins mechanically,
only half-conscious of herself. <i>Pah!
pah!</i> and again <i>crack!</i> The blue rifle-smoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was in her eyes and nostrils, the Mauser bullets
pattered like hail on the road; and still
Aquila galloped on, never turning his head,
never slackening his mighty stride, and still
the road rushed by, and the turn by the hill
grew nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pah!</i> Rita felt her companion wince. His
left arm relaxed its hold and dropped at his
side. With his right hand he carefully
replaced his carbine in its sling.</p>

<p>"For life, Aquila!" he said softly, in Spanish;
and once more Aquila gathered his great
limbs under him, and once more the terrible
pace quickened.</p>

<p>A stone? a hole in the road? who knows?
In a moment they were all down, horse and
riders flung in a heap together. The horse
struggled to his knees, then fell again.
He screamed, an agonising sound, that in
Rita's excited mind seemed to mingle with
the smoke and the dust in a cloud of horror.
Every moment she expected to feel the iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hoofs crashing into her, as the frenzied creature
struggled to regain his footing.</p>

<p>Delmonte had sprung clear, and in an
instant he was at Rita's side, raising her.
"You are hurt? no? good! keep behind me,
please."</p>

<p>He went to the horse, and tried to lift him,
bent to examine him, and then shook his
head. Aquila would not rise again; his leg
was shattered. Delmonte straightened himself
and looked about him. If this had happened
a hundred, fifty yards back! but now
the woods were gone, and on either hand
stretched a bare savannah, broken only by
the hateful barbed wire fences. He drew his
revolver quietly. The healthy brown of his
face had gone gray; his eyes were like blue
steel. He looked at Rita, and met her eyes
fixed on him in a mute anguish of entreaty.</p>

<p>"Have no fear!" he said. "It shall be as
it would with my own sister. I know these
men; they shall not touch you alive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent once more over the struggling
beast, and even in his agony Aquila knew
his master, and turned his eyes lovingly
toward him, expecting help; and help came.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, lad!" The pistol cracked, and
the tortured limbs sank into quiet.</p>

<p>"Lie down behind him!" Delmonte commanded.
"So! now, still."</p>

<p>He knelt behind the dead horse, facing the
advancing Spaniards. The revolver cracked
again, and the foremost horseman dropped,
shot through the head. The troop was now
close upon them; Rita could see the fierce
faces, and the gleam of their wolfish teeth.
Delmonte fired again, and another man
dropped, but still the rest came on. There
was no help, then?</p>

<p>Delmonte looked at Rita; she closed her
eyes, expecting death. The air was full of
cries and curses. But&mdash;what other sound
was that? Not from before, but behind them&mdash;round
the turn of the road&mdash;some one was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
singing! In all the hurry of her flying
thoughts Rita steadied herself to listen.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For it's whoop-la! whoop!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Git along, my little dogies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For Wyoming shall be your new home!&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What in the Rockies is going on here,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>Rita turned her head. A horseman had
come around the bend, and checked his horse,
looking at the scene before him. A giant
rider on a giant horse. The moon shone on
his brown uniform, his slouched felt hat, and
the carbine laid across his saddle-bow. Under
the slouched hat looked out a bronzed face,
grim and bearded, lighted by eyes blue as
Delmonte's own.</p>

<p>Rita gave one glance. "Help!" she cried,
"America, help!"</p>

<p>"America's the place!" said the horseman.
He waved his hand to some one behind him,
then put his horse to the gallop. Next instant
he was beside them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Delmonte started to his feet, revolver in
hand. "U. S. A.?" he said. "You're just
in time, uncle. I'm glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Always like to be on time at a party,"
said the rough rider, levelling his carbine.
"My fellows are&mdash;in short, here they are!"</p>

<p>There was a scurry of hoofs, a shout, and
thirty horsemen swept around the curve and
came racing up.</p>

<p>"What's up, Cap'n Jim?" cried one.
"Have we lost the fun? Gringos, eh?
hooray!"</p>

<p>The Spaniards had checked their horses.
Four of them lay dead in the road, and several
others were wounded. At sight of the
mounted troop, they stopped and held a
hurried consultation, then turned their horses
and rode away.</p>

<p>The giant looked at Delmonte. "Want to
follow?" he asked. "This is your hand,
comrade."</p>

<p>"I want a horse!" said Captain Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
"Miss Montfort,"&mdash;he turned to Rita, who
had risen to her feet, and stood pale but
quiet,&mdash;"these are our own good country-men.
If I leave you with them but a few
moments&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" said the big man. "What
did you call the young lady?"</p>

<p>Delmonte stared. "This is Miss Montfort,"
he said, rather formally.</p>

<p>"Not Rita!" cried the giant. "Pike's
Peak and Glory Gulch! Don't tell me it's
Rita!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes!" cried Rita, running forward
with outstretched hands. "It is&mdash;I
am! and you&mdash;oh, I know, I know. You
are Peggy's big brother. You are Cousin
Jim!"</p>

<p>"That's what they said when they christened
me!" said Cousin Jim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>MEETINGS AND GREETINGS.</h3>


<p>It was no time for explanations. Jim
Montfort put out a hand like a pine knot,
and gave Rita's fingers a huge shake.</p>

<p>"Glad to find you, cousin," he said. "I've
been looking for you. Now, what's up over
there?" He nodded in the direction of the
fire.</p>

<p>"A <i>candela</i>," said Delmonte, briefly. "I
must get back; there are women there. If
one of your men will catch me that horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are wounded!" cried Rita.
"Cousin, he is shot in the arm. Do not
let him go!"</p>

<p>Delmonte laughed. "It's nothing, Miss
Montfort," he said; "but nothing at all, I
assure you. When we get to camp you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
shall put some carbolic acid on it, and tie it
up for me; that's field practice in Cuba. I
shall be proud to be your first field patient."
He spoke in his usual laughing way; but suddenly
his face changed, and he leaned toward
her swiftly, his hand on the horse's mane. "I
shall never forget this time&mdash;our ride together,"
he said. "I hope you will not forget
either&mdash;please? And now, Miss Montfort,
I have no further right over you. I would
have done my best, I think you know that;
but&mdash;I must give you into your cousin's
protection. You will remain here?"</p>

<p>"Of course she will!" said Cousin Jim, who
had heard only the last words. "I'll go with
you, comrade. Raynham, Morton, you will
mount guard by the lady."</p>

<p>The troopers saluted, and raised their
hats civilly to Rita, inwardly cursing their
luck. Because they owned the next ranch
to Jim Montfort, was that any reason why
they should lose all the fun? and why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
could not girls stay at home where they
belonged?</p>

<p>But Rita herself cried out and clasped her
hands, and ran to her cousin. "Oh, Cousin
Jim&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Delmonte&mdash;let me go with you!
Please, please let me go back. My poor
Manuela&mdash;Marm Prudence&mdash;they may be
hurt, wounded. There can be no danger with
all these brave men. Cousin, I have been in
a camp hospital, I know how to dress wounds.
I can be quiet&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Delmonte, tell him I
can be quiet!"</p>

<p>She looked eagerly at Delmonte.</p>

<p>"I can tell him that you are the bravest
girl I ever saw," he said. "But, you have
been through a great deal. I don't like to
have you go back among those rascals."</p>

<p>James Montfort stroked his brown beard
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Guess it's safe enough," he said at last.
"Guess there's enough of us to handle 'em.
Don't know but on the whole she'll be better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
off with us. My sister Peggy wouldn't like
to miss any circus there was going, would
she, little girl? Catch another of those
beasts for the lady, Bill!"</p>

<p>Rita, with one of her quick gestures, caught
his great hand in both hers. "Oh, you good
cousin!" she cried. "You dear cousin! You
are the very best and the very biggest person
in the world, and I love you."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" said Cousin Jim, somewhat
embarrassed. "There, there! so you
shall, my dear; so you shall. But as for
being big, you should see Lanky 'Liph of
Bone Gulch. Now there&mdash;but here is your
horse, missy."</p>

<p>The horses of the dead Spaniards had been
circling about them, more or less shyly. Two
of them were quickly caught by the rough
riders, and Rita and Delmonte mounted. As
they did so, both glanced toward the spot
where lay the brave horse that had borne
them so well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was for life indeed, Aquila!" said
Captain Jack, softly. His eyes met Rita's,
and she saw the brightness of tears in them.
Next moment they were galloping back to
the <i>residencia</i>.</p>

<p>They came only just in time. Not ten
minutes had passed since they left the courtyard,
but in that time the savage Spaniards
had done their work well. The house itself
was in flames, and burning fiercely. Good
Don Annunzio lay dead, carbine in hand,
on the steps of his ruined home. Beside him
lay the Creole youth in whose charge Delmonte
had left Manuela. The lad was still
alive, for as Delmonte bent from the saddle
above him he raised his head.</p>

<p>"I did my best, my captain!" he said.
"They were too many."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Delmonte and
Montfort in one breath.</p>

<p>The boy pointed down the road; raised his
hand to salute, and fell back, dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs07.png" width="400" height="270" alt="&quot;NOW AGAIN IT WAS A RIDE FOR LIFE.&quot;" title="&quot;NOW AGAIN IT WAS A RIDE FOR LIFE.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;NOW AGAIN IT WAS A RIDE FOR LIFE.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Now again it was a ride for life&mdash;not their
own life this time. Rita had clean forgotten
herself. The thought of her faithful friend
and servant in the hands of the merciless
Spaniards turned her quick blood to fire.
She galloped steadily, her eyes fixed on the
cloud of dust only a few hundred yards ahead
of them, which told where the enemy was
galloping, too.</p>

<p>Jim Montfort glanced at her, and nodded
to himself. "She'll do!" he said in his
beard. "Montfort grit's good grit, and she's
got it. This would be nuts to little Peggy."</p>

<p>Jack Delmonte, too, looked more than once
at the slender figure riding so lightly between
him and the big rough rider. How beautiful
she was! He had not realised half how beautiful
till now. What nerve! what steadiness!
It might be the <i>Reina de Cuba</i>, Donna Hernandez
herself, riding to victory.</p>

<p>He felt an unreasonable jealousy of "Cousin
Jim." Half&mdash;nay! a quarter of an hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
ago, she was riding with him; there were only
they two in the world, they and Aquila, poor
Aquila,&mdash;who had given his life for theirs.
She was his comrade then, his charge, his&mdash;and
now she was Miss Montfort, a young
lady of fortune and position, under charge
of her cousin, a Yankee captain of rough
riders; and he, Jack Delmonte, was&mdash;nothing
in particular.</p>

<p>As he was thinking these thoughts, Rita
chanced to turn her head, and met his gaze
fixed earnestly upon her. She blushed suddenly
and deeply, the lovely colour rising in
a wave over cheeks and forehead; then turned
her head sharply away.</p>

<p>"Now I have offended her!" said Jack.
"Idiot!" and perhaps he was not very wise.</p>

<p>But there was little time for thinking or
blushing. The Spaniards, seeing Delmonte,
whom they regarded as the devil in person,
descending upon them in company with a
giant and an army (for so they described the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
band of rough riders at headquarters next
day), abandoned their prisoners. The Americans
chased them for a mile or so, killed
three or four, and, as they reported, "scared
the rest into Kingdom Come," leaving them
only on coming to a thick wood, into which
the Gringos, leaping from their horses, vanished,
and were seen no more. The victors
then returned to the forlorn little group of
women and negroes, huddled together by the
roadside. Rita had already dismounted, and
had Manuela in her arms. She felt her all
over, hurrying question upon question.</p>

<p>"My child, you are not hurt? not wounded?
these ruffians&mdash;did they dare to touch you?
did they have the audacity to speak to you,
Manuela? Oh, why did I leave you? I could
not help it; you saw I could not help it.
You are <i>sure</i> you have no hurt?"</p>

<p>"But, positively, se&ntilde;orita," said Manuela.
"See! not a scratch is on me. They&mdash;one
fellow&mdash;offered to tie my hands; I scratched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
him so well that he ran away. I am safe,
safe&mdash;praise be to all saints, to our Holy
Lady, and the Se&ntilde;or Delmonte. But&mdash;poor
Cerito, se&ntilde;orita? what of him? he
was with us; he fought like a lion. I saw
him fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor Cerito!" said Rita, gravely. "He
was a brave, brave lad. A thousand sons
to Cuba like him!"</p>

<p>Donna Prudencia was sitting apart on a
stone by the roadside. Rita went up to her,
took her hand, and kissed her cheek. The
Yankee woman looked kindly at her and
nodded comprehension, but did not speak.
Rita stood silent for a few minutes, timidly
stroking the brown cheek and white hair.
Her cousin Margaret came into her mind.
What would Margaret say, if she were here?
She would know the right word, she always
did.</p>

<p>"Marm Prudence," she said, presently, "to
have the memory of a hero, of one who dies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
for his country,&mdash;that is something, is it not?
some little comfort?"</p>

<p>Marm Prudence did not answer at once.</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," she said, presently. "Mebbe
so, Miss Margaritty. Noonzio was a good
man. Yes'm, I've lost a good husband and
a good home! A good husband and a good
home!" she repeated. "That's all there is
to it, I expect." Her rugged face was disturbed
for a moment, and she hid it in her
hands; when she looked up, she was her own
composed self.</p>

<p>"And what's the next thing?" she asked.
"Thank you, Cap'n Delmonty, I'm feeling
first-rate. Don't you fret about me. You
done all you could. I'll never forget what
you done. Poor husband's last words before
he was shot was thanking the Lord Miss
Margaritty was off safe. We knew we could
trust her with you."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said honest Delmonte, "it is not
me you must thank, Donna Prudencia. I did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
what I could, but it was Captain Montfort
and his men who saved both her life and
mine."</p>

<p>He told the story briefly, and Marm Prudence
listened with interest. "Well," she
said, "that was pretty close, wasn't it?
Anyway, you done all you could, Cap'n
Jack, and nobody can't do no more. And he's
Miss Margaritty's cousin, you say? I want
to know! He's big enough for three, ain't
he?"</p>

<p>Rita laughed, in spite of herself. She
beckoned to Cousin Jim, who came up and
shook hands with the widow with grave sympathy.
But he seemed preoccupied, and, while
they were preparing to return to the ruined
farm, he was pulling his big beard and meditating
with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he broke out at last, addressing
his men. "I've been wondering
what was wrong. I couldn't seem to round
up, somehow, and now I've got it. Where's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
that poor old Johnny? I left him with you
when I rode forward to reconnoitre."</p>

<p>The rough riders looked at one another,
and hung their heads.</p>

<p>"Guess he must have dropped behind,"
said Raynham. "We didn't wait long after
you signalled to us to come on. We&mdash;came."</p>

<p>"That's so!" clamoured the rough riders,
in sheepish chorus. "We came, Cap'n Jim.
That's a fact!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's all right!" said Jim. "You
might have brought the old Johnny along,
though, seems to me. Two of you ride back
and get him; you, Bill, and Juckins. If he
seems used up, Juckins can carry him, pony
and all."</p>

<p>Juckins, a huge Californian, second only to
Montfort in stature, chuckled, and rode off
with Raynham at a hand gallop.</p>

<p>Montfort turned to Rita.</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to tell you about it
before," he said. "Cousin Rita, I've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hunting for you for three days. We met an
old Johnny&mdash;an old gentleman, I should
say&mdash;riding about on a pony, for all the
world like Yankee Doodle. He'd got lost,
poor old duffer, among these inferior crossroads,
and didn't know whether he was in
China or Oklahoma. We picked him up, and,
riding along, it came out that he was searching
for his ward, a young lady who had run
away from a convent. Ever heard of such
a person, missy? He had started out alone,
to ride about Cuba till he found her. Kind
of pocket Don Quixote, about five foot high,
white hair, silk clothes; highly respectable
Johnny."</p>

<p>"Don Miguel!" cried Rita. "Poor, dear,
good Don Miguel! I have never written to
him, wicked that I am. Oh, where is he,
Cousin Jim?"</p>

<p>"Come to ask him," Jim continued, "it
appeared that the young lady's name was
Montfort. Now, I had just had a letter from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Uncle John, wanting me to raise the island to
get hold of you and ship you North at once.
He had had no letters; was alarmed, you
understand. Laid up with a bad knee, or
would have come himself. I was just going
to start back to the city in search of you,
when up comes Don Quixote. When he
heard I was your cousin, he fell into my
arms, pony and all. Give you my word he
did! Almost lost him in my waistcoat pocket.
I cheered him up a bit, and we've been poking
about together these three days, looking for
General Sevillo's camp. Thought you might
be there. We were camping by the roadside
when we heard your firing. Ah! here he
comes now!"</p>

<p>The rough riders came back, their horses
trotting now, instead of galloping. Between
them, ambling gently along, was a piebald
pony of amiable appearance, and on the pony
sat a little old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gentlemen'">gentleman</ins> with snow-white
hair and a face as mild and gentle as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pony's own. At sight of Rita running to
meet him, he uttered a cry of joy, and
checked his horse. Next moment he had
dismounted, and had her in his arms, sobbing
like a child.</p>

<p>"Dear Donito Miguelito!" cried Rita.
"Forgive me! please do forgive me, for
frightening you. I could not go to the convent,
indeed I could not. I am a wretch to
have treated you so, but I could not go to
that place."</p>

<p>"Of course you could not, my child," said
the good old man. "<i>Nunc dimittis</i>, Domine!
Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.
Of course you could not."</p>

<p>"I could not live with Concepcion; don't
you know I could not, Donito Miguelito?"</p>

<p>"The thought is impossible, my Pearl.
Speaking with all possible respect, the Se&ntilde;ora
Montfort, though high-born and accomplished,
is a hysterical wildcat. You did well, my
child; you did extremely well. So long as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have found you, nothing matters; but, nothing
at all. As my great, my gigantic friend, my
colossal preserver, el Capitan Gimmo, says,
'Ourrah for oz!'"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the rough riders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER CAMP.</h3>


<p>They made but a brief halt at the ruined
farm. The house was completely gutted;
the widow of Don Annunzio had the clothes
she stood in, and nothing beside. She stood
quietly by while her husband's body was laid
in the grave beside that of young Cerito; a
shallow grave, hastily dug in what had lately
been the garden. She listened with the same
quiet face while good old Don Miguel, with
faltering voice, recited a Latin prayer. She
was a Methodist, he a fervent Catholic; but
it mattered little at that moment.</p>

<p>By this time it was daylight. A small
patch of bananas was found, that had escaped
the destroying torch, and on these the
party made a hasty meal; then they rode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
away, all save the negroes, who preferred to
stay in the neighbourhood where their lives
had been spent.</p>

<p>They rode slowly, in deference to Don
Miguel's age and that of his pony. Rita,
riding beside the good old man, listened to
the recital of his terrors and anxieties from
the time her flight was discovered to the
present moment. These caused her real
grief, and she begged again and again for
the forgiveness which he assured her was
wholly unnecessary. But when he described
the hysterical rage of her stepmother, her
eyes brightened, and the colour came back to
her pale cheek. She had no doubt that Concepcion
Montfort was sorry to lose her; the
larger part of her father's fortune had been
settled upon her, Rita, before his second
marriage.</p>

<p>"The se&ntilde;ora also has made diligent search
for you, my child!" said Don Miguel. "She
has offered ample rewards&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it!" said Rita. "Only yesterday&mdash;can
it be that it was only yesterday?&mdash;Don
Diego Moreno was here&mdash;there, I
should say, at that peaceful home that is now
a heap of ashes. These Spaniards!"</p>

<p>Had she seen Don Diego? the old man
asked; and he seemed relieved when she
answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"It is well; it is well!" he said. "He is
a relative of the se&ntilde;ora's, I am aware; but it
would have been unsuitable, most unsuitable."</p>

<p>"What would have been unsuitable, Donito
Miguelito?"</p>

<p>Don Miguel looked confused. "A&mdash;nothing,
my child. The Se&ntilde;ora Montfort had an
idea&mdash;Don Diego made certain advances&mdash;in
short, he would have asked for your hand,
my se&ntilde;orita&mdash;well, my Margarita, if you
will have it so. But I took it upon myself
to refuse these overtures without consulting
you."</p>

<p>Rita heard a low exclamation, and turning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
saw Delmonte's face like dark fire beside
her.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" he said. "I could
not help hearing. Don Miguel, if Diego Moreno
makes any more such proposals, kindly
let me know, and I'll shoot him at sight."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;thank you! thank you, my son!"
said Don Miguel, somewhat fluttered. "I
hope no violence will be necessary. I used
strong language, very strong language, to
Don Diego Moreno. I&mdash;I told him that
I considered him a person entirely objectionable,
unfit to sweep the road before the Se&ntilde;orita
Montfort's feet. He went away very
angry. I thought we should hear no more of
him; but it seems that he still retains his
presumptuous idea. Without doubt, it will
be best, my dear child, for you to seek the
northern home of your family without delay."</p>

<p>Why, at this obviously sensible remark,
should Rita feel a sinking at the heart, and a
sudden anger against her dear old friend?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
And again, why, on stealing a glance at Delmonte,
and seeing the trouble reflected in his
face, should her heart as suddenly spring up
again, and dance within her? What had
happened?</p>

<p>They had ridden some miles, when Jim
Montfort, on his big gray horse, ranged alongside
of Delmonte.</p>

<p>"It appears to me," he said, "that something
is going on in these woods here. I've
seen two or three bits of brown that weren't
bark, and if I didn't catch the shine of a gun-barrel
just now, you may call me a Dutchman.
I think I'll fire, and see what
happens."</p>

<p>"No, don't do that!" said Delmonte,
quietly. "It's only my fellows. They've
been keeping alongside for the last half-mile,
waiting for a signal. They might as well
come out now."</p>

<p>He gave a low call in two notes; the call
Rita had heard&mdash;was it only the night be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>fore?
it seemed as if a week had passed since
then.</p>

<p>The call was answered from the wood; and
as if by magic, from every tree, from every
clump of bushes, came stealing lean brown
figures, leading equally lean horses, all
armed and on the alert. They saluted, and,
at a word from the burly Juan, fell into order
with the precision of a troop on drill.</p>

<p>"What's all this, Juan?" asked Delmonte.
"No order was given."</p>

<p>Juan replied with submission that a negro
boy had brought news an hour ago that Don
Annunzio's house had been burned, he and
his whole household murdered, and their
captain taken prisoner; and that the latter
was being brought in irons along the road to
Santiago. They, Juan and the rest, had
planned a rescue, and disposed themselves to
that end in the most advantageous manner.
That they were about to fire, when they recognised
their captain's escort as Americans;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and that they then resolved to accompany
the party as quietly as might be till they
came near the camp, and then make their
presence known to all, as they had at
once made it known to Delmonte himself
by a low call which only he had noticed.</p>

<p>"Not wishing to intrude," Juan concluded,
with a superb salute.</p>

<p>Delmonte turned to his companions. "Miss
Montfort," he said, "Captain Montfort&mdash;you'll
all come up to my place, of course,
and rest, for to-day, at least. It isn't much
of a place to ask you to, but&mdash;it's quiet, at
least, and&mdash;you can rest; and you must be
half-starved. I know I am."</p>

<p>His face was eager as a boy's. Rita's was
not less so, as she gazed at the big cousin,
who stroked his beard as usual, and reflected.</p>

<p>"I did mean to push straight on to Santiago,"
he said, "but&mdash;it's a good bit of
a way, to be sure; what do you say, little
cousin? tired? hey?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Rita blushed. "A&mdash;a little tired, Cousin
Jim; and <i>very</i> hungry!"</p>

<p>This settled it. Captain Montfort bid Delmonte
"fire away." The latter said a few
rapid words to Juan, and the scout shot off
like an arrow across the fields, riding as if
for his life.</p>

<p>An hour later, the whole party was seated
around a fire, in as comfortable a nook of the
hills as guerilla leader could desire, sipping
coffee, and eating broiled chicken and fried
bananas, fresh from the <i>parilla</i>. The fire
was built against a great rock that rose
abruptly from the dell, forming one side of
it, and towering so high that the smoke disappeared
before it reached the top. Thick
woods framed the other sides of the natural
fastness, and here the Cuban riders could lie
hidden for days and weeks, unsuspected, unseen,
save by the wandering birds that now
and then circled above their heads. No tents
or huts here; the horses were tethered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
trees; the commander's hammock was
swung in a shady thicket near the great
rock; as for his men, a ragged blanket
and the "soft side of a stone" were all they
asked.</p>

<p>Rita had dressed Captain Delmonte's
wound, and bandaged the arm in approved
style, Cousin Jim looking on with grunts of
approval. He and Delmonte himself both
assured her that, if they were handling it,
they should simply squirt carbolic acid into
it, and tie it up with anything that came
handy; but Rita shook her head gravely, and
three of her delicate handkerchiefs, brought
from the long-suffering bag which Manuela
had somehow managed to save from the
ruins, torn into strips, made a very sufficient
bandage. The wound was, in truth, slight.
Delmonte looked almost as if he wished it
more severe, for the whole matter of bathing
and dressing could not be stretched beyond
ten minutes; but Rita's pride in her neat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
bandage was pretty to see, and he watched
her with delighted eyes through every
stage.</p>

<p>"Snug quarters!" said Jim Montfort, approvingly,
as, the breakfast over, he stretched
his huge length along the grass and looked
about him; and all the party echoed his
opinion. The two captains fell into talk of
the war and its ways, while the women,
wearied out, rested after their long night
of distress and fatigue. Marm Prudence
chose the dry grass, with a cloak for a
pillow, but Rita curled herself thankfully in
Captain Jack's hammock, after trying in vain
to persuade him that he was an invalid, and
ought to take it himself. After some rummaging
in a hole in the rock which served
him for cupboard and wardrobe, Delmonte
brought her a small pillow in a somewhat
weather-beaten cover. "I wish I had a better
one," he said. "This has been out in the
rain a good deal, and I'm afraid it smells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of smoke, but it's a great pillow for sleeping
on."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" said Rita. "It is very
comfortable indeed. How good you are to
me, Captain Delmonte. And whatever you
may say, it is a great shame for me to take
your own hammock. If there were only
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't!" said Jack. "It's
really&mdash;you must not talk so, Miss Montfort.
As if there was anything I wouldn't
do&mdash;why, this hammock will never be the
same again. I&mdash;I mean&mdash;oh, you know
what I mean, and I never could make pretty
speeches. But&mdash;it is a pleasure, and&mdash;an
honour, to have you here; and you can't
think how much it means to me. Good
night! I mean&mdash;sleep well."</p>

<p>He added a few words of a German song
relative to the desirability of a certain lovely
angel's slumbering sweetly. Rita did not
understand German, but the tone of Del<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>monte's
voice was in no particular language,
and, tired as she was, it was some time before
she went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when they took the
road again. Before starting they held a council,
seated together beneath the great tree,
under whose shade Rita had slept peacefully
for several hours. Jim Montfort was the first
speaker.</p>

<p>"I take it," he said, "we'd better, each
one of us, say what we mean to do. Then
the sky will be clear, and we can fit in or
shake apart, as seems best in each case. We
all ride together to Pine del Rio, as Captain
Delmonte is so friendly as to ride with us.
After that&mdash;I'll begin with you, ma'am."
He addressed, the widow respectfully. "How
can I best serve you? I am going to see
my cousin safe off, and you must call upon
me for any service I can possibly render
you."</p>

<p>"She will stay with me!" cried Rita.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
"Dear Marm Prudence, you will stay with
me, will you not?"</p>

<p>Marm Prudence shook her head, though
with a look of infinite kindliness. "Thank
you, dear," she said; "it's like you to say it,
but I'm going home to Greenvale, Vermont.
I've a sister living there yet. I'll go back to
my own folks at last, and lay my bones alongside
o' mother's. I'll never forgit you, though,
Miss Margaritty," she added, "nor you, Cap'n
Jack. There! I can't say much yet."</p>

<p>She turned away, and all were silent for
a moment, as she wiped the tears from her
rugged face.</p>

<p>"You go straight home, I suppose, sir?"
said Jim, addressing Don Miguel.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried the little gentleman. "I
go to Pine del Rio with my dear ward here.
To see her safe on board a good vessel, bound
for the North; to say farewell to the joy of
my old days, and put out the light of my
eyes&mdash;that is my one sad desire, Se&ntilde;or Mont<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>fort.
After that&mdash;I am old, I have but a
short time left, and my prayers will require
that."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it seems as if the first thing
on all hands was to find a steamer sailing for
home," said Jim. "If Mrs. Annunzio will
take charge of you, Cousin Rita, I think that
will be the best thing. Uncle John will send
some one to meet you in New York and take
you to Fernley. How does that suit you?"</p>

<p>Rita was silent. She had grown very pale.
Delmonte looked at her eagerly, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>"What do you say, little cousin?" repeated
Montfort. "You have a mind of your own,
and a pretty decided one, if I'm not mistaken.
Let's hear it!"</p>

<p>Rita spoke slowly and with difficulty, her
ready flow of speech lacking for once.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jim&mdash;dear Don Miguel&mdash;you are
both so kind, so good. You too, Marm Prudence.
I love the North. I love my dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
uncle and cousin&mdash;ah, how dearly!&mdash;but&mdash;I
do not want to go to Fernley."</p>

<p>"Not want to go!" repeated the others.</p>

<p>"No! indeed, indeed, I cannot go. I have
been thinking, Cousin Jim, a great deal, while
all these things have been happening; these
wonderful, terrible things. I&mdash;I ought to
have learned a great deal; I hope I have
learned a little. I have talked enough about
helping my country; too much I have talked;
now I want to do something. I am going to
work in one of the hospitals. Nurses are
needed, I know, every day more of them.
I do not know enough&mdash;yet&mdash;to be a nurse,
but I can be a helper. I am very humble; I
will do the meanest work, but&mdash;but that is
what I mean to do."</p>

<p>She ceased, and all the others, looking in
her face, saw it bright and lovely with earnest
resolve. But Don Miguel cried out in expostulation.
It was impossible, he said. It could
not be. She was too young, too delicate, too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>&mdash;the
proposition was monstrous. He appealed
to Captain Montfort to support him,
to exercise his authority, to persuade this
dear child that the noble idea which filled
her young and ardent heart was wholly
impracticable.</p>

<p>Jim Montfort was silent for a time, looking
at Rita from under his heavy eyebrows. Presently&mdash;"You
mean it?" he said.</p>

<p>"I mean it with all my heart!" said Rita.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "my opinion is&mdash;considering
my sister Peggy and her views, to
say nothing of Jean and Flora&mdash;my opinion
is, Rita&mdash;hurrah for you!"</p>

<p>A month ago, Rita would have gone into
violent heroics at such a moment as this. As
it was, she smiled, though her eyes filled with
tears, and said, quietly, "Thank you, cousin!
It is what I expected from Peggy's brother."</p>

<p>"May I speak?" said another voice. They
turned, and saw Jack Delmonte, his blue eyes
alight with eager gladness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"If&mdash;if Miss Montfort has this noble desire
to help in the good cause," he said, "it is easy
for her to do it. My mother has turned her
<i>residencia</i>, just outside the city, into a hospital.
I am going there to-day. She needs
more help, I know. You&mdash;you would like
my mother, Miss Montfort; everybody likes
my mother. She would do all she could to
make it easy for you, and she would be so
glad&mdash;oh, I can't tell you how glad she
would be. And I think you are quite certain
to like her."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Rita. "Have I not heard of
the Saint of Las Rosas? There is no need to
tell me how good and how noble the Se&ntilde;ora
Delmonte is. But&mdash;but will she like me,
Captain&mdash;Captain Jack?"</p>

<p>"Will she?" said Jack. "Will the sun
shine?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.</h3>


<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Las Rosas</span>, June &mdash;, 1898.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle John:</span>&mdash;Since I last wrote
you, telling of our finding Rita, and of her
safe delivery to Se&ntilde;ora Delmonte, things have
been happening. In the first place, I got a
shot in my leg, in a skirmish, and, as the
bone was broken, and it didn't seem to come
round as it ought, I came here to be coddled,
and am having a great time of it. Se&ntilde;ora
Delmonte is a fine woman, sir. You don't
see many such women in a lifetime. She has
a little hospital here, as complete as if she had
New York City in her back dooryard; all her
own place, you understand. Kind of Florence
Nightingale woman. What's more, little Rita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
promises to become her right hand; if she's
given a chance, that is&mdash;I'll come to that by
and by, though. The way that little girl
takes hold, sir, is a caution. She's quick,
and she's quiet, and she's cheerful; and she
has brains in her head, which is a mighty
good thing in a woman when you do find it.
She and Se&ntilde;ora Delmonte are like mother
and daughter already; and this brings me to
something else I want to say. It's pretty
clear that Jack Delmonte has lost his heart
to this little girl of ours. It began, I suspect,
the night he carried her off from the Spaniards;
you have heard all about that; and
it's been going on here, while a little flesh
wound he had was healing. Yes, sir, he's in
it deep, and no mistake; and, for that matter,
I guess she is, too, though those things aren't
in my line. Anyhow, what I want to say
is this: Jack Delmonte is as fine a fellow
as there is this side of the Rockies; and I
don't know that I'll stop there, barring my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
brother Hugh. This war isn't going to last
much longer. By some kind of miracle, this
place&mdash;sugar plantation, and well paying in
good times&mdash;hasn't been meddled with; and
Jack ought to be able to support a wife, if he
puts good work into the business, as he will.
He's a first-rate all-round fellow, and has
brains in his head&mdash;said that before, didn't
I? well, it's a good thing in a man, too. I'm
not much of a hand at writing, as I guess
you'll see. All I mean to say is, if he and
little Rita want to hitch up a double team,
my opinion is it would be a mighty good
thing, and I hope you'll give them your
blessing and all that sort of thing, when
the time comes.</p>

<p>Much obliged for your letter, but sorry your
knee still bothers you. Father has been laid
up, too, so he writes; rheumatism. I'm getting
on first-rate, and shall be out of this soon. I
think a month or so more will see the whole
blooming business over, and peace declared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Time, too! this is no kind of a country to
stay in.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your affectionate nephew,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">James Montfort.</span><br />
</div>

<p>P.S. Tell Cousin Margaret that J. D. is
<i>all right</i>.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Las Rosas</span>, June &mdash;, 1898.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Montfort:</span>&mdash;I wonder if
you remember Mary Russell, with whom you
used to dance now and then when you came
to Claxton in the old days, we will not say
how many years ago. I certainly have not
forgotten the pleasant partner who waltzed so
well, and I am glad to have the opportunity
of claiming acquaintance with you. I meant
to write as soon as your niece arrived at my
house, but the battle in this neighbourhood the
day after brought us such an influx of wounded
that my hands were very full, and the hasty
dictated line was all I could manage. We are
now in a little eddy of the storm (which, we
hope, is nearly over), and have only a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
men in the house, and most of these convalescent;
so I must not delay longer in assuring
you of the very great pleasure and help it has
been to me to have Margarita with me. Indeed,
I hardly know what I should have done
without her the first week, as two of my
nurses were ill just at the time when we
were fullest. She shows a remarkable aptitude
for nursing, which is rather singular,
as she tells me that until lately she has been
extremely timid about such matters, fainting
at the sight of blood, etc. You never would
think it now, to see her going about her work
in the wards. The patients idolise her, and
what is more (and less common), so do the
nurses, who declare that she will miss her
vocation if she does not go into a training-school
as soon as she leaves Las Rosas; but
I fancy you would not choose so arduous a
life for her.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="331" height="400" alt="&quot;THE PATIENTS IDOLISE HER.&quot;" title="&quot;THE PATIENTS IDOLISE HER.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE PATIENTS IDOLISE HER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>This brings me, my dear Mr. Montfort, to
what is really the chief object in my writing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to you to-day. Without beating about the
bush, I am going to say, at once and frankly,
that my dear son, Jack, has become deeply
attached to this charming niece of yours.
Who could be surprised at it? she must
always have been charming; but the sweetness
and thoughtfulness that I have seen
growing day by day while she has been
under my charge are, I somehow fancy, a
new phase of her development. Indeed, Rita
herself has told me, in her vivid way, of
some of the wild pranks of her "unguided
youth," as she calls it,&mdash;the child will be
nineteen, I believe, on her next birthday!&mdash;and
we have laughed and shaken our heads
together over them. She is far more severe
upon herself than I can be, for I see the quick,
impulsive nature, and see, too, how it is being
subdued and brought more and more under
control by a strong will and a good heart.
A very noble woman our Rita will make, if
she has the right surroundings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Can we give her these? that is the question;
a question for you to answer, dear Mr.
Montfort. Jack saw readily, when I pointed
it out to him, that it would not be suitable
for him to speak of love to an orphan girl&mdash;an
heiress, too, I believe&mdash;without her guardian's
express consent. He chafes at the delay,
for he is very ardent, being half Cuban; but
you may have entire confidence that he will
say nothing to Rita until I hear from you.</p>

<p>You can easily find out about Jack; there
is nothing in his life that he need conceal.
Colonel G. and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, in New York, Professor
Searcher and Doctor Lynx, of Blank
College, will tell you of his school and college
days; and Captain Montfort will, I think,
say a good word for his record as a soldier
and a patriot. Of course, in my eyes, he is a
little bit of a hero; but maternal prejudice
laid aside (if such a thing may be!), I can
truly say that he is a clean, honest, high-minded
man, with a sound constitution and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
an excellent disposition. Add to this a moderate
income (not, I am happy to say, enough
to allow him to dispense with work, were he
inclined to do so, which he is not), and a
very earnest and devoted attachment, and
you have the whole case before you. May
I hope to have your answer as soon as you
shall have satisfied yourself on the various
points on which you will naturally seek information?
I assure you that, with the best
intentions in the world, Jack does find it
hard to restrain himself. Let me add that,
if your answer is favourable, it will make
me as well as my son very happy. Rita is
all that I could wish for in a daughter; and
I shall try my best to fill a mother's place
toward her.</p>

<p>In any case, believe me, dear Mr. Montfort,</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">Cordially yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mary Russell Delmonte.</span><br />
</div>

<p>P.S. You may ask, does Rita return Jack's
affection? <i>I think she does!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honoured Se&ntilde;or:</span>&mdash;Your valued letter,
containing inquiries on the subject of Se&ntilde;or
Captain John Delmonte is at hand and contents
notified. I hasten to reply with all the
ardour of which I am capacious. This young
man is a nobleman; few princes have equalled
him in virtuous worth. Brave, honourable,
pious (though Protestant; but this belief is
probably your own, and is held by many of
those most valuable to me, your honoured
brother among them), a faithful and obedient
son, a leader beloved to rapture by his
soldiers. If more could be to say, I would
hasten to cry it aloud. You tell me, with
noble frankness, he is a pretender for the
hand of my beloved Margarita; already it
has been my happiness to be aware of it.
Se&ntilde;or Montfort, to see these two admirable
young persons united in the holy bondages
of weddinglock is the last and chief wish
of my life. I earnestly beg your sanction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
their unition. In Jack I find a son for my
solitary age; in Margarita a daughter, the
most tender as she is the most beautiful that
the world contains. To close my aged eyes
on seeing them unified, is, I repeat it, the one
wish of,</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Honoured Se&ntilde;or,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your most obedient and humble servitor,</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Monfort:</span>&mdash;I have just
read your letter to my mother, and I want to
thank you before I do anything else. There
isn't much to say, except that I will do my
best to be in some degree worthy of this treasure,
if I win it. I will try to make her happy,
sir, I will indeed. No one could be good
enough for her, so I will not pretend to that.</p>

<p>She is awake now, so I must go.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Gratefully yours,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Las Rosas</span>, Evening.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest, dearest Margaret:</span>&mdash;Why are
you not here? I want you&mdash;oh, I want you
so much! I am so happy, so wonderfully,
almost <i>terribly</i> happy, how can I put it on
paper? The paper will light itself, will burn
up for joy, I think; but I will try. Listen!
an hour ago&mdash;it is an evening of heaven, the
moon was shining for me, for me and&mdash;oh,
but wait! I was in the garden, resting after
the day's work; I had been asleep, and now
would take the remainder of my free time
in waking rest. The air was balm, the roses
all in blossom. Such roses were never seen,
Marguerite; the place is named for them,
Las Rosas. They are in bowers, in garlands,
in heaps and mounds&mdash;I smell them now.
The rose is my flower, remember that, my
life long. I used to tell you it was the
jessamine; the jessamine is a simpleton, I
tell you. I was picking white roses, the
kind that blushes a little warm at its heart&mdash;when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I heard some one coming. I knew
who it was; can I tell how? It was Captain
Jack. I trembled. He came to me, he spoke,
he took my hand. Oh, my dear, my dear,
I cannot tell you what he said; but he loves
me; he is my Jack, I am his Rita. Marguerite,
will you tell me how it can be true?
Your wild, silly, foolish Rita, playing at
emotions all her childish life: she wakes up,
she begins to try to be a little like you, my
best one; and all of a sudden she finds herself
in Paradise, with a warrior angel&mdash;Marguerite,
I did not think of it till this moment;
my Jack is the express image of St. Michael.
His nose tips up the least bit in the world&mdash;I
don't mind it; it gives life, dash, to his
wonderful face; otherwise there is <i>no</i> difference.
My St. Michael! my soldier, my Star
of Horsemen! Marguerite, no girl was
ever so happy since the world was made.
Oh, don't think me fickle; let me tell you!
In the South here, are we different? It must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
be so. I <i>was</i> fond of Santayana; but that
was in another life. I was a sentimental,
passionate child; he was handsome as a
picture; it was a dream of seventeen. Now&mdash;can
you believe that I am a little grown
up? I really think I am. Perhaps I think
it most because now, for the first time, I
<i>really</i> want to be like you, Marguerite. I
used to be so pleased with being myself&mdash;I
was the vainest creature that ever lived.
Now, I want to be like you instead; I want
to be a good woman, a good wife. Ah! what
a wife you will make if you marry! But
how can you marry, my poor darling? There
is only one man in the world good enough
for you, and he is mine. I cannot give him
up, even to you, my saint. I have two saints
now; I ought to be a Catholic. The second
one is his mother, the Saint of Las Rosas, as
she is called all through this part of the
island. Marguerite, I must strive to grow
like her, too, if such a thing were possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
I have work enough for my life, but what
blessed work! to try to make myself worthy
of Jack Delmonte, my Jack, my own!</p>

<p>He took me to his mother; I have just
come from her. I am her daughter from
that moment, she says; oh, Marguerite, I
will try to be a good one. Hear me&mdash;no!
I am not going to make vows any more, or
talk like girls in novels; I am just going to
try. I loved her from the first moment I
saw her grave, beautiful face. She took me
in her arms, my dear; she said things&mdash;I
have come up here to weep alone, tears of
happiness. Dearest, you alone knew thoroughly
the old Rita, the foolish creature, who
dies, in a way, to-night. Say good-bye to her;
give her a kiss, Marguerite, for she too loved
you; but not half as dearly as does the new,
happy, blessed</p>
